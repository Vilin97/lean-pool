"""Layered layout for per-project dependency graphs.

Pure Python, no third-party dependencies. The pipeline is:

1. iterative Tarjan strongly-connected components (the largest project has
   ~7.7K nodes, so no recursion),
2. condensation + longest-path layering: layer 0 = no intra-project
   dependencies; every member of an SCC shares a layer; otherwise
   ``layer = 1 + max(layer(dep))`` over dependencies outside the SCC,
3. within-layer ordering by barycenter crossing reduction: the initial
   order is ascending node id (callers assign ids in ``(module, line)``
   order), then four alternating forward/backward sweeps sort each layer by
   average neighbor position with a deterministic tie-break on the initial
   order.
