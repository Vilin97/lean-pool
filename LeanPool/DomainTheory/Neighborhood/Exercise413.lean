# Exercise 4.13 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture IV) — eliminating the circularity

The proof of Theorem 4.1 uses the integers (the chain `fⁿ(⊥)`), whereas the proof
of Theorem 4.6
uses 4.1 — *a hint of circularity*. Scott shows it can be eliminated:

**(1)** If a domain `𝒟` has an element `a` where, for `f : 𝒟 → 𝒟`, the relation
`f(a) ⊑ a` holds,
then the least fixed point can be defined *without* the integers, purely by a
greatest-lower-bound:

  `fix(f) = ⋂ {x ∈ |𝒟| ∣ f(x) ⊑ x}`,

and `fix(f) ⊑ a`. Here `b = ⋂{…}` is a well-defined element by Exercise 1.18
(`sInf`, the
intersection of a non-empty family of filters). The argument uses **only the
monotonicity** of
`f : |𝒟| → |𝒟|` — no directed sups, no integers:

* `f(b) ⊑ x` whenever `f(x) ⊑ x` (since `b ⊑ x` so `f(b) ⊑ f(x) ⊑ x`), hence `f(b)
⊑ b`;
* then `f(f(b)) ⊑ f(b)`, so `b ⊑ f(b)` too; thus `b = f(b)`;
* `b` is least among pre-fixed points, in particular the least fixed point.

This is `monoFix` / `monoFix_isFixed` / `monoFix_least` / `monoFix_le_preFix`
below. It is entirely
**choice-free** (`#print axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}`).

**(2)** The argument uses only monotonicity, and `(1)` *always* applies to
power-set domains `P A`
(take `a = A`, the top element, where `f(A) ⊑ A` is automatic) — see Exercise
4.14.

**(3)** With `(1)` one re-establishes the recursion principle behind 4.6 directly:
for any structured
set `⟨Z, z, ·⟩` there is a *unique* `s : ℕ → Z` with `s(0) = z` and `s(n⁺) =
s(n)·`
(`exists_unique_nat_rec`). This is the choice-free primitive recursion theorem;
combined with `(1)`
it removes the circularity (one no longer needs 4.1 to build the iteration).

**(4)** Specializing `(3)` to `⟨ℕ, 0, ⁺⟩` recovers the very iteration `n ↦ fⁿ`
used in 4.1
(`nat_iterate_unique`), closing the loop without circularity.

purely as the greatest lower bound of the pre-fixed points, `⋂ {x ∣ f(x) ⊑ x}`.
Well-defined as an

/-- **Exercise 4.13(1) (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** `monoFix f ha` is a fixed point:
`f(b) = b`. (After
`f(b) ⊑ b`, monotonicity gives `f(f(b)) ⊑ f(b)`, so `f(b)` is itself a pre-fixed
point, whence
`b ⊑ f(b)`.) -/

/-- **Exercise 4.13(3) (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** For any structured set `⟨Z, z, ·⟩`
(`z : Z`,
`op : Z → Z`) there is a *unique* `s : ℕ → Z` with `s(0) = z` and `s(n⁺) = (s
n)·`. This is the
choice-free recursion principle (`Nat.rec`); together with 4.13(1) it eliminates
the circularity in
the proofs of 4.1 and 4.6. -/

structured set
`⟨ℕ, 0, ⁺⟩`: the *unique* function `s` with `s(0) = 0` and `s(n⁺) = (s n)⁺` is the
identity. This
is the iteration `n ↦ fⁿ` underlying Theorem 4.1, now justified without
circularity. -/
