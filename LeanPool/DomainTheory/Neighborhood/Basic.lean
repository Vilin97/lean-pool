# Neighborhood systems (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §1) — foundations

Following Dana Scott, *Lectures on a Mathematical Theory of Computation*,
Technical
Monograph PRG-19, Oxford (May 1981), Lecture I, *Domains given by neighbourhoods*.

Scott fixes a non-empty set `Δ` of *tokens* and considers a family `𝒟` of subsets
of `Δ`
(the *neighbourhoods*). The order is *reversed* relative to information: a
**smaller**
neighbourhood carries **more** information. A finite sequence of neighbourhoods is
*consistent* when it has a common lower bound inside `𝒟` (a `Z ∈ 𝒟` contained in
all of
them); a neighbourhood system is closed under intersections of consistent finite
sequences.

This file formalizes the very first page of §1:

* **Definition 1.1** — `NeighborhoodSystem`: a family with `Δ ∈ 𝒟` (condition (i))
and
  closure under consistent binary intersections (condition (ii)).
* **Factoid 1.1a / 1.1b** — Scott's recursive *convention* for the finite
intersection
  `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ` (`interUpTo`): the empty intersection is `Δ`, and the
  `(n+1)`-fold
  intersection peels off the last factor.
* **Theorem 1.1c** — "from (ii) we can extend the intersection property to any
finite
  sequence", and *consequently* a finite sequence is consistent **iff** its
  intersection
  lies in `𝒟`.

The §1 core is deliberately **constructive**: Scott uses *partial* filters so that
the
basic theory avoids maximal-filter existence (Zorn/choice). Every theorem here
depends only
on `propext`/`Quot.sound` (no `Classical.choice`).
-/

namespace Domain.Neighborhood

/-- **Definition 1.1 (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** A *neighbourhood system* over a token
type
`α`. `mem X` means "`X` is a neighbourhood" (`X ∈ 𝒟`), and `master` is Scott's
least
informative neighbourhood `Δ` (the whole token set, "ask me no questions").

The two conditions are exactly Scott's:

* (i)  `Δ ∈ 𝒟`                                        — `master_mem`;
* (ii) whenever `X, Y, Z ∈ 𝒟` and `Z ⊆ X ∩ Y`, then `X ∩ Y ∈ 𝒟` — `inter_mem`.

We keep `master` as a field (rather than hard-wiring `Set.univ`) to stay faithful
to
Scott's `Δ` notation, and record Scott's standing assumption `𝒟 ⊆ 𝒫(Δ)` as the
field
`sub_master` (every neighbourhood is a subset of `Δ`). The latter is what makes
the principal
filter `↑X` (Definition 1.7) contain `Δ`, and underlies the least element `⊥ =
↑Δ`. -/
structure NeighborhoodSystem (α : Type*) where
  /-- `mem X` holds iff `X` is a neighbourhood of the system (`X ∈ 𝒟`). -/
  mem : Set α → Prop
  /-- Scott's distinguished least-informative neighbourhood `Δ`. -/
  master : Set α
  /-- (i) `Δ ∈ 𝒟`. -/
  master_mem : mem master
  /-- (ii) Closure under intersection of a *consistent* pair: if `X, Y, Z ∈ 𝒟`
  with the
  witness `Z ⊆ X ∩ Y`, then `X ∩ Y ∈ 𝒟`. -/
  inter_mem : ∀ {X Y Z : Set α}, mem X → mem Y → mem Z → Z ⊆ X ∩ Y → mem (X ∩ Y)
  /-- Scott's `𝒟 ⊆ 𝒫(Δ)`: every neighbourhood is a subset of the master
  neighbourhood `Δ`. -/
  sub_master : ∀ {X : Set α}, mem X → X ⊆ master

/-- Scott's *"very special circumstance"* (the prose after Examples 1.2–1.4): a
family `𝒟`
is **nested-or-disjoint** when any two of its members are either nested (one
included in the
other) or disjoint. -/
def NestedOrDisjoint {α : Type*} (mem : Set α → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃X Y : Set α⦄, mem X → mem Y → X ⊆ Y ∨ Y ⊆ X ∨ X ∩ Y = ∅

/-- **Factoid 1.4a (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** "In these systems two neighbourhoods
are either
disjoint or one is included in the other": a family containing `Δ` whose members
are pairwise
nested-or-disjoint **is** a neighbourhood system. This uniformly explains why
Examples 1.2,
1.3 and 1.4 satisfy Definition 1.1.

The verification of condition (ii) needs no choice: if `X, Y` are nested then `X ∩
Y` is the
smaller (already in `𝒟`); if they are disjoint then the consistency witness `Z ⊆ X
∩ Y = ∅`
forces `Z = ∅`, whence `X ∩ Y = ∅ = Z ∈ 𝒟`. The caller supplies `sub_master`
(Scott's
`𝒟 ⊆ 𝒫(Δ)`) directly. -/

system is *positive* when Scott's (ii) is strengthened to the biconditional

/-- **Exercise 1.19 — a positive system is a neighbourhood system.** Scott:
"*prove that a
positive neighbourhood system is indeed a neighbourhood system*". From the raw
data — (i)
`Δ ∈ 𝒟`, `𝒟 ⊆ 𝒫(Δ)`, and the positivity axiom (ii′) — condition (ii) follows: a
consistency
witness `Z ⊆ X ∩ Y` with `Z ∈ 𝒟` is itself non-empty (apply (ii′) to `Z ∩ Z = Z`),
so
`X ∩ Y ⊇ Z` is non-empty, whence `X ∩ Y ∈ 𝒟` by (ii′). Choice-free. -/

again a

Stated honestly: if
the filter `x` has a `⊆`-minimum member `X` (one contained in every member of
`x`), then `x` is
exactly the principal filter `↑X`. In a *finite* system every filter has such a
minimum (the
intersection of its finitely many members, itself in `x` by closure), so every
element is
principal; that finiteness step is the only classical ingredient and is left
implicit here — this
constructive core captures the content.

`⊆`: any `Z ∈ x` satisfies `X ⊆ Z` by minimality, so `Z ∈ ↑X`. `⊇`: `Z ∈ ↑X` means

/-- **Definition 1.9 (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** Two neighbourhood systems `𝒟₀` and
`𝒟₁` (over possibly
*different* token types) *determine isomorphic domains* iff there is a one-one,
inclusion-preserving
correspondence between `|𝒟₀|` and `|𝒟₁|`. We package "one-one + preserves
inclusion (both ways)" as
mathlib's order-isomorphism `≃o`: an `OrderIso` is automatically a bijection that
*reflects* as well
as preserves `⊑` (`map_rel_iff`), which is exactly Scott's requirement. -/
