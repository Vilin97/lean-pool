# Definition 7.1 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §7) — computable presentations / effectively
given domains

Following Dana Scott, *Lectures on a Mathematical Theory of Computation*, PRG-19,
Lecture VII,
*Computability in effectively given domains*.

Scott's idea: the *finite elements* of `|𝒟|` are the ones initially known, and to
know a finite
element is to know how it is **related** to the other finite elements. As finite
elements are in
one-one correspondence with neighbourhoods (Definition 1.7), the data reduces to
*recursive
calculations with neighbourhoods*. This forces at most a countable infinity of
neighbourhoods.

> **Definition 7.1.** A neighbourhood system `𝒟` has a *computable presentation*
provided we can
> write `𝒟 = {Xₙ ∣ n ∈ ℕ}`, where the two relations
>
> * (i)  `Xₙ ∩ Xₘ = X_k`, and
> * (ii) `∃ k. X_k ⊆ Xₙ and X_k ⊆ Xₘ`
>
> are recursively decidable (in `n, m, k` and in `n, m` respectively).

**Recursion theory: we roll our own and reject Mathlib here.** "Recursively
decidable" is modelled by
`Domain.Recursive.RecDecidable` — the existence of a primitive-recursive
`{0,1}`-valued
characteristic function, with tuples coded by `Nat.pair`. We deliberately do
**not** use Mathlib's
recursion theory (`ComputablePred` / `Primrec` / `Partrec`): in Mathlib `v4.30.0`
essentially all of
its *correctness lemmas* are proved with `grind`/`lia` or the `@[simp]` lemma
`Nat.unpair_pair`,
which **open `Classical`**, so they audit with `Classical.choice`. This project's
discipline is to
keep constructions choice-free (`⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}`), so we rebuilt the
slice of recursion
theory we need (choice-free `Nat.sqrt` correctness, the `Nat.pair`/`unpair`
round-trips, and
primitive-recursive `id`/`+`/`*`) in `Domain/Neighborhood/Recursive.lean`.
Relation (i) is the
ternary `interEq` predicate (`RecDecidable₃`); relation (ii) is the binary
consistency predicate
(`RecDecidable₂`). The enumeration `X` is the only *data* the structure carries (a
plain
`ℕ → Set α`), so building a presentation stays choice-free.

The intuitive content (Scott's prose): (i) lets us *locate* the intersection of
two neighbourhoods
in the standard list, and (ii) is the *consistency condition* — the necessary and
sufficient
condition for the intersection to exist in `𝒟`. Scott immediately remarks the
biconditional
`Xₙ ⊆ Xₘ ↔ Xₙ ∩ Xₘ = Xₙ`, which makes the **inclusion** relation decidable from
(i); we record this
as `ComputablePresentation.incl_computable`, and equality of neighbourhoods as
`eq_computable`.

A neighbourhood system is *effectively given* when it admits such a presentation
(`NeighborhoodSystem.IsEffectivelyGiven`). The one-point system `𝟙` is the sanity
inhabitant
(`unitSys_isEffectivelyGiven`).

/-- **Definition 7.1 (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** A *computable presentation* of a
neighbourhood system
`V` over a token type `α`: an enumeration `X : ℕ → Set α` whose range is exactly
`𝒟` (`mem_X` and
`surj`), such that Scott's two relations on the integer indices are recursively
decidable:

* `interEq_computable` is (i): the ternary relation `Xₙ ∩ Xₘ = X_k`;
* `cons_computable` is (ii): the binary consistency relation `∃ k. X_k ⊆ Xₙ ∩ Xₘ`
  (Scott's `X_k ⊆ Xₙ and X_k ⊆ Xₘ`).

Only the enumeration `X` is data; the remaining fields are `Prop`s, so a
presentation is built
choice-free. -/

  /-- A **primitive-recursive intersection function**: an index of `Xₙ ∩ Xₘ`
  whenever that
  intersection is a neighbourhood (i.e. consistent). This makes explicit the
  operation that 7.1(i)
  is *about*: in Scott's general-recursive reading of "recursively decidable" the
  index can be
  recovered from `interEq_computable` by an (unbounded) search `μk. Xₙ ∩ Xₘ =
  X_k`, but that search
  is not *primitive* recursive; for the function-space presentation (Theorem 7.5)
  we need to
  *form* component intersections primitively, so we carry the function as part of
  the data of an
  ("acceptable") computable presentation. Off the consistent domain `inter n m`
  may be junk. -/
