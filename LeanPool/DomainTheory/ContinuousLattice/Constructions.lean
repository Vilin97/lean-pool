# Continuous lattice constructions (Scott 1972, §2.8–2.12)

The Milner correction (March 1972, pp. 135–136) is in `MilnerCorrection.lean`.
Full proofs of
2.8–2.12 under `CoarserThanScottTopology` are the remaining 1972 items; the
Sierpiński
injectivity base case (1.2) is already complete.

This file additionally proves Scott's first two example/closure results, the
order-theoretic
content of Propositions 2.8 (finite lattices are continuous) and 2.9 (products of
continuous
lattices are continuous). The accompanying topological claims of 2.9–2.10 ("the
induced
topology agrees with the product / subspace topology") are the parts that require
the Milner
correction and remain open.

element of
`S` (which exists by finiteness) is, by directedness, the greatest element, hence
the
supremum. This is the order-theoretic heart of "finite ⟹ continuous" (Scott 1972,
2.8). -/

product of any
family of continuous lattices is a continuous lattice. (Part (b), that the induced
topology of
the product agrees with the product topology, is `proposition_2_9_b` below;
`proposition_2_9`
bundles the two.)

The key step is that if `a ≪ yᵢ` in the factor `Dᵢ`, then the cylinder element
`[a]ⁱ`
(equal to `a` in coordinate `i` and `⊥` elsewhere) is way below `y` in the
product: the
preimage `{z | zᵢ ∈ U}` of a Scott-open witness `U ⊆ Dᵢ` is Scott-open in the
product
(suprema are computed coordinatewise). Any upper bound `b` of `{x | x ≪ y}`
therefore
dominates every `[a]ⁱ`, so `a = ([a]ⁱ)ᵢ ≤ bᵢ`; ranging over `a ≪ yᵢ` and using
continuity of
`Dᵢ` gives `yᵢ ≤ bᵢ` for all `i`, i.e. `y ≤ b`. -/

/-! ### Proposition 2.9(b): the induced topology of a product is the product
topology

Scott 1972, Proposition 2.9 also asserts that the Scott topology of the product
`∏ᵢ Dᵢ` of
continuous lattices coincides with the topological product of the Scott topologies
of the factors.
We prove the two inclusions:

* **Product ⊆ Scott** (`scottTopologicalSpace ≤ Pi.topologicalSpace`): every
projection
  `eval i` preserves directed suprema (they are computed coordinatewise), hence is
  Scott-continuous,
  hence the Scott topology of the product is finer than each induced topology,
  i.e. finer than their
  infimum (the product topology).
* **Scott ⊆ Product** (`Pi.topologicalSpace ≤ scottTopologicalSpace`): given a
Scott-open `U` and a
  point `z ∈ U`, the `↟a` basis (`exists_wayBelow_Ici_subset`) yields `a ≪ z` with
  `↑a ⊆ U`. A
  way-below element of a product has **finite support**
  (`wayBelow_finite_support`) and is
  way-below in each coordinate (`wayBelow_proj`); the resulting finite box
  `⋂_{i ∈ F} eval i ⁻¹' (↟aᵢ-neighbourhood of zᵢ)` is a product-open neighbourhood
  of `z` inside
  `↑a ⊆ U`. -/

/-- Plugging a value into a fixed coordinate, `v ↦ Function.update z i v`,
preserves directed
suprema: away from `i` the result is the constant `z j`, and at `i` it is the
identity. -/

directed family with supremum `z`; since `a ≪ z = ⊔_F Z F`, already `a ≤ Z F` for

/-! ### Proposition 2.11: continuous lattices are injective

The substance of Scott's Theorem 2.12. We give the explicit extension operator
`g(y) = ⊔_{V ∋ y open} ⊓ f''(e⁻¹V)` and prove (a) it extends `f` along an
embedding `e`
(using continuity of `D` to interpolate from below) and (b) it is Scott-continuous
(using the
`↟a` basis of the Scott topology). -/

/-- Scott's canonical extension of `f : X → E` along `e : X → Y` (Scott 1972,
proof of 2.11):

needed to *state*
the operator — it is purely order-theoretic. -/

open `V ⊆ Y` on whose `e`-preimage `f ≥ a`, so `a ≤ ⊓ f''(e⁻¹V) ≤ g(e x₀)`. -/

embedding, then for each continuous `f : X → E` the explicit formula `scottExtend

(`scottExtend_continuous`), it
