# The vertex squares, the last parameter inside a closed set, and the cores

Three of the ordinary bricks of the polygonal redrawing of a finite plane graph.

**The vertex squares.** Around each vertex of a finite plane graph sits a closed axis-parallel
square which meets no other vertex and no edge arc of an edge not incident with that vertex.
One compact separation per other vertex and per non-incident arc, then the single-`ε`-for-all
lemma of `Schoenflies/UniformBound.lean`. Squares rather than disks because the assembly needs
the boundary to be made of segments; convexity, which the radial segments of the last step
want, both shapes have.

Because the choice is made once for all vertices rather than vertex by vertex, halving the
common radius also makes *distinct squares disjoint* — which the cores of the next brick need
and which the per-vertex statement does not give. That is why `exists_vertexSquares` is the
form to consume and `exists_square_at` only its ingredient.

**The last parameter inside a closed set.** The parameters at which an arc lies in a closed
set form a compact subset of the parameter interval; if it is nonempty its supremum is
attained, and past that supremum the arc has left the set for good. The mirror statement about
the infimum is what the far end of an edge wants: the arc leaves the square at `v` for the last
time and enters the square at `w` for the first time.

**The cores.** The subarc of an edge between those two parameters. It meets the square at `v`
in its own first endpoint only, the square at `w` in its own last endpoint only, and — the
clause the assembly really uses — it contains no vertex, which makes distinct cores disjoint
without any further estimate.

## Blueprint

Bricks B2, B3 and B4 of `lem:polygonal-redrawing`.

* `Plane.closedBall_subset_closedSquare`, `Plane.closedSquare_subset_ball` — a square sits
  inside a ball and vice versa, the comparison every separation argument passes through.
* `Plane.supDist_triangle`, `Plane.closedSquare_mono_center`, `Plane.mem_closedSquare_self` —
  square arithmetic missing from `Schoenflies/Square.lean`.
* `exists_last_mem_Icc`, `exists_first_mem_Icc`, `exists_last_mem`, `exists_first_mem` — B3,
  with `isCompact_parameters_mem` behind them.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_square_at` — B2 at one vertex.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_vertexSquares` — B2 as consumed: one radius for every vertex, with
  distinct squares disjoint.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_core` — B4, the core of one edge.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.disjoint_of_subset_edgeArc` — B4's "distinct cores are disjoint".
* `Graph.IsDrawing.closedSquare_disjoint_edgeArc_of_ne` — B4's "meets no other vertex square",
  which is a property of the whole arc.

the first entry into the far vertex's square — has to happen after the last exit from the near
one, i.e. on the interval `[a, 1]`. -/

/-- B2 as its consumers want it: **one** radius serving every vertex at once, with the squares
about distinct vertices disjoint.

Disjointness is not a consequence of the per-vertex statement — a square about `v` avoiding
`w` says nothing about a square about `w` reaching towards `v`. It comes from choosing the
radius once for all vertices and then halving it: two squares of radius `r` that met would put
their centres within `2r` in the sup metric, i.e. each centre in the other's square of radius
`2r`, which the unhalved choice forbids. -/

/-- "The core meets no other vertex square" is really a statement about the whole arc: the
square about a vertex which is neither end of the edge misses the edge's arc entirely, by B2.

other edge's arc at all, because distinct edges meet only at vertices. Stated for arbitrary
subsets rather than for cores, since that is all the argument uses — and it is why
`exists_core` carries `Disjoint K V(G)` rather than a clause about other edges. -/

/-- **The core of an edge.** Between the last parameter at which the edge's arc is inside the
square about `v` and the first parameter after that at which it is inside the square about `w`
sits a subarc `K` — the core — which meets the square at `v` in its first endpoint only, meets
the square at `w` in its last endpoint only, and contains no vertex at all.

The two squares must be disjoint, which is what the uniform choice of `exists_vertexSquares`
provides; disjointness in particular forces `v ≠ w`, so **this says nothing about a loop
edge** — see the module report.

The "first entry after the last exit" is not the same as "first entry": nothing forbids the
arc from dipping into the far square and coming back, so the second application of B3 is over
`[a, 1]` and not over `[0, 1]`.

That the endpoints of the core are *not* the vertices themselves is where the positivity of
the radius is used: the arc starts at the centre of the square about `v`, so it is still
inside the square just after leaving it, and the last exit therefore happens at a positive
parameter. That fact is what makes `Disjoint K V(G)` true and hence distinct cores disjoint. -/
