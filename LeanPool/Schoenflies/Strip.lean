# Two-sided polygonal strips

This module builds the *collar* of Lemma 1.8: an open neighbourhood `N` of a simple closed
polygon `P` whose complement in `N` splits into two connected open sets, the two local sides.

The blueprint's construction is "a small closed disk about every vertex, a thin rectangular
block about every edge, chosen so that consecutive blocks overlap and nonadjacent closures are
disjoint". The blocks here are

* `Plane.cone v A R` — the open sector of radius `R` about a vertex `v` cut out by an arc `A`
  of directions, and
* `Plane.strip a u t₁ t₂ s₁ s₂` — the open rectangle around a directed edge, written in the
  edge's own coordinates `t = ⟪u, x - a⟫` (along) and `s = det u (x - a)` (across).

Everything about the *side matching at a vertex* comes from `Schoenflies/Direction.lean`
through the orientation form; no angle is named. The one new direction fact needed here is the
sign-free repackaging `Plane.germs_split'`: the blueprint's `germs_split` assumes
`0 < det r₁ r₂`, but a polygon turns both ways, and it turns out that *which* named arc carries
the left germs does not depend on the sense of the turn — it is always `arcCCW r₂ r₁`. Only the
side of the smallness hypothesis moves.

## The constants

The blueprint says "the blocks may be chosen so that consecutive edge and vertex blocks overlap
in the prescribed small rectangles around the radial segments, while the closures of all
nonadjacent blocks are disjoint" without naming the constants. `Schoenflies.StripData` names
them: a cone radius `R`, a trim `lam` by which each edge block stops short of its endpoints, and
a half-width `rho`. They should be chosen in this order (this is the recipe the unproved
`exists_stripData` has to follow):

1. `R` from the vertex separations, from the distance of each vertex to the nonincident edges
   (with a factor `2` of slack, spent in `dist_core_vertex`), and from the prescribed open set;
2. `lam := R / 5`, which makes `2 * lam < R` (the cones reach past the ends of the blocks they
   must overlap) and `4 * lam < ‖edge‖` (the blocks are nonempty);
3. `rho` from the distance of each trimmed edge to the other edges, and from the *germ
   threshold* `rho * (1 + |⟪r₁, r₂⟫|) ≤ lam * |det r₁ r₂|` at every vertex — this last is the
   quantitative form of "make the strips narrow enough that this side matching holds in every
   vertex disk", and it is the only inequality in the list that is not a separation of compact
   sets.

## Blueprint

* `Plane.germs_split'` — the sign-free vertex matching inside Lemma 1.8.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` — a simple closed polygonal curve presented by its cyclic vertex
  list.
* `Schoenflies.StripData` — the choice of constants, as a hypothesis.
* `Schoenflies.StripData.sideL`, `.sideR`, `.nbhd`, `.sideL_disjoint_sideR` — the two labelled
  sides of the collar, and that they are disjoint.

## Where the rest of Lemma 1.8 lives

This module builds the apparatus and proves the hard half: the germ matching at a corner and
the disjointness of the two labelled sides. The other two obligations are discharged next door,
and were split out only because they were built concurrently:

* `Schoenflies/StripConstants.lean` — `exists_stripData` and `exists_stripData_subset`, which
  produce the constants, the latter with the collar inside a prescribed open set.
* `Schoenflies/StripConnected.lean` — that each side is connected, and
  `nbhd \ carrier = sideL ∪ sideR`.

`Schoenflies.polygonal_collar` in `Schoenflies/Compose.lean` is the three composed into the
blueprint's Lemma 1.8 (a). `ClosedPolygon.collar` below is a *definition*, not the theorem.

What is still missing from Lemma 1.8 as a whole: the **local two-sidedness** clause (every
sufficiently small disk about a point of the curve meets the complement in exactly two
components, one in each side), and part **(b)**, the arc case.

/-! ### A sign-free vertex matching

`Plane.germs_split` fixes the orientation with `0 < det r₁ r₂`. A polygon turns both ways, so
the collar needs the statement without that hypothesis. The content of the repackaging is that
the *conclusion* does not move: the two left germs always land on `arcCCW r₂ r₁` and the two
right germs on `arcCCW r₁ r₂`. What moves is which pair needs the smallness hypothesis, so the
sign-free form simply imposes it on both, with absolute values. -/

/-- **The vertex matching, sign-free.** With `r₁` the ray back along the incoming edge and `r₂`
the ray out along the outgoing edge, the two *left* half-strip germs lie on `arcCCW r₂ r₁` and
the two *right* ones on `arcCCW r₁ r₂`, whichever way the polygon turns. The hypothesis
`s * |⟪r₁, r₂⟫| < t * |det r₁ r₂|` is the blueprint's "`s/t` small", written without a division
and without a sign. -/

by the two arcs are exactly the two components of the ball minus the two incident radial
segments, which is what makes the labelling at a vertex well defined. -/

`StripData` is the blueprint's "choose the blocks so that consecutive ones overlap and
nonadjacent closures are disjoint", with every constant named. The three numbers are a cone
radius `R`, a trim `lam` and a half-width `rho`; the separation hypotheses are exactly the
instances of Lemma 1.4 (b) that the construction consumes, and `germ` is the vertex-matching
threshold. Producing them is the unproved `exists_stripData`; see the Status section. -/
