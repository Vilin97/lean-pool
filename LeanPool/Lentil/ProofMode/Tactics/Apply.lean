`tla_apply t` is implemented through `tla_have := t`.

First, `tlaHaveTerm` introduces the theorem to apply as the newest temporal
hypothesis and delegates all supplied arguments to `tla_specialize`. Then this
file inspects that newest hypothesis, splits its remaining implication chain
with `TLA.Expr.splitImplicationsIntoParts`, and applies `Entails_apply_hyp` with
an explicit list of premise metavariables of the same length. This avoids the
old residual-premise guessing loop.

`tla_apply t` proves the current proof-mode goal using a TLA theorem or a
temporal hypothesis. If the theorem concludes the current goal but still has
unsupplied temporal premises, those premises become new proof-mode goals.

For example, if the context contains `hp : p` and the goal is `q`, then
`tla_apply h hp` closes the goal when `h` proves `p |-tla- q`:
```lean
tla_apply lemma hp
```

If the goal is `r` and `lemma hp` has type `q |-tla- r`, then
```lean
tla_apply lemma hp
```
changes the goal to `q`.
