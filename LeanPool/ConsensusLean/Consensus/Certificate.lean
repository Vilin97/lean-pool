# The certificate bridge — executable consensus checking with proved soundness

`Consensus.Quorum` proves agreement as an *abstract* property (`∀` over all quorum
subsets) — a proof obligation, not something a runtime can evaluate. This file builds the
**bridge** the design calls for: a **decidable, executable** certificate checker over
concrete data, together with a machine-checked theorem that *acceptance implies the
abstract agreement guarantee*. This is the "reject-or-discharge a real run" artifact —
the verified core that an MCP Consensus-Seal sidecar calls on every gated action.

## The objects

* `Config` — a concrete configuration: an explicit `Finset` roster of members. The quorum
  rule is strict majority of the roster (decidable, no abstract `∀`).
* `Cert` — a per-action certificate: a chosen `value` and the `Finset` of members who
  voted for it (the evidence the agent action carries).
* `Valid cfg vote c` — the decidable acceptance predicate: the voters are members, they
  form a strict majority, and each one's recorded vote matches the certificate's value.
* `check` — the same thing as a runnable `Bool`; `check_iff` ties it to `Valid`.

## What is proved (the bridge)

* `Valid` is `Decidable` — the checker is executable; the seal can actually run it.
* `cert_agreement` — **soundness**: if two certificates are both valid against the same
  configuration, their values are equal. So the checker can never discharge two
  conflicting actions.
* `no_conflicting_certs` — the same, stated as "`check` never accepts a conflicting pair."
* `cert_agreement_cross` — **soundness across a reconfiguration**: two valid certificates
  against *different* configurations agree, given a decidable per-instance overlap witness
  (their voter counts exceed the combined roster). This is the runtime-checkable form of
  `Reconfig.Compatible`, fused into the bridge.

Everything here is `Finset`-level and computable: feed it concrete rosters, votes, and a
certificate and it returns accept/reject, with the guarantee that an accepted pair can
never disagree. The development uses only Lean's standard trusted base.
