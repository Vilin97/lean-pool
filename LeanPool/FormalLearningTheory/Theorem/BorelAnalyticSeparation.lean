# Borel-Analytic Separation: Counterexample Chain

The singleton class over an analytic non-Borel set A ⊆ ℝ witnesses that
WellBehavedVCMeasTarget (NullMeasurableSet) is strictly weaker than
KrappWirthWellBehaved (MeasurableSet/Borel).

## Main results

- `singletonClassOn_measurable`: every hypothesis in the singleton class is measurable
- `singleton_badEvent_eq_preimage_planar`: bad event = preimage of planar witness
- `planarWitnessEvent_analytic`: the planar witness is analytic
- `planarWitnessEvent_not_measurable`: the planar witness is NOT Borel
- `singleton_badEvent_not_measurable`: the sample-space bad event is NOT Borel

/-! ## Definitions -/

/-- The constantly false concept. The base hypothesis of the singleton class, serving
both as the target concept and as the `zeroConcept` disjunct of `singletonClassOn`. -/
noncomputable def zeroConcept : Concept ℝ Bool := fun _ => false

/-- The point indicator `singletonConcept a x = (x = a)`. Each `singletonConcept a` is
itself Borel measurable; non-Borelness in the singleton-class witness comes from
quantifying over `a ∈ A` for `A` analytic non-Borel, not from any individual concept. -/
noncomputable def singletonConcept (a : ℝ) : Concept ℝ Bool :=
  fun x => if x = a then true else false

/-- The singleton class over `A ⊆ ℝ`: `{zeroConcept} ∪ {singletonConcept a | a ∈ A}`.
The `zeroConcept` disjunct is the target concept against which the symmetrization bad
event is measured. For `A` analytic non-Borel, this is the witness used to separate
`WellBehavedVCMeasTarget` from the Krapp-Wirth Borel condition. -/
def singletonClassOn (A : Set ℝ) : ConceptClass ℝ Bool :=
  {h | h = zeroConcept ∨ ∃ a ∈ A, h = singletonConcept a}

/-- The planar witness `{(x, y) ∈ ℝ × ℝ | y ∈ A ∧ x ≠ y}`. For `A` analytic non-Borel,
this set is itself analytic non-Borel. The geometric core of the separation: the
learning-theoretic bad event below is a measurable preimage of this planar set. -/
def planarWitnessEvent (A : Set ℝ) : Set (ℝ × ℝ) :=
  {q | q.2 ∈ A ∧ q.1 ≠ q.2}

/-- The ghost sample space at sample size `m = 1`: `(Fin 1 → ℝ) × (Fin 1 → ℝ)`. The
smallest sample size at which the singleton-class obstruction is already visible. -/
abbrev GhostPairs1 := (Fin 1 → ℝ) × (Fin 1 → ℝ)

/-- The projection `GhostPairs1 → ℝ × ℝ`, `p ↦ (p.1 0, p.2 0)`. Surjective and
measurable; non-Borelness of a target set transfers to non-Borelness of its preimage
under a measurable surjection. -/
def samplePair1ToPlane : GhostPairs1 → ℝ × ℝ :=
  fun p => (p.1 0, p.2 0)

/-- The symmetrization bad event for the singleton class at sample size `m = 1`, target
concept `zeroConcept`, and threshold `1 / 2`. Equals the preimage of `planarWitnessEvent`
under `samplePair1ToPlane` (see `singleton_badEvent_eq_preimage_planar`), and inherits
both analyticity and non-Borelness from the planar set when `A` is analytic non-Borel. -/
def singletonBadEvent (A : Set ℝ) : Set GhostPairs1 :=
  {p | ∃ h ∈ singletonClassOn A,
    EmpiricalError ℝ Bool h (fun i => (p.2 i, zeroConcept (p.2 i))) (zeroOneLoss Bool) -
    EmpiricalError ℝ Bool h (fun i => (p.1 i, zeroConcept (p.1 i))) (zeroOneLoss Bool) ≥
      (1 : ℝ) / 2}

/-! ## Theorem G -/

/-- Every hypothesis in `singletonClassOn A` is Borel measurable: `zeroConcept` is
constant, and each `singletonConcept a` factors through `measurableSet_singleton`. The
class is regular at the level of individual hypotheses; non-measurability enters only
through the existential over `A`. -/

/-- The singleton bad event equals `samplePair1ToPlane ⁻¹' planarWitnessEvent`. The set
equality that transports both analyticity and non-Borelness from the planar witness to
the learning-theoretic bad event. -/

/-! ## Theorem I -/

/-- For `A` analytic, `planarWitnessEvent A` is analytic. The proof presents it as the
intersection of `Prod.snd ⁻¹' A` (analytic, by preimage of analytic under a continuous
map) with the Borel set `{(x, y) | x ≠ y}` (the complement of the diagonal). Analytic
sets are closed under intersection with Borel sets. -/

/-! ## Theorem J -/

/-- For `A` non-Borel, `planarWitnessEvent A` is non-Borel. The proof picks some
`a ∉ A` and shows the vertical section `y ↦ (a, y)` pulls the planar event back to `A`
itself: if the planar event were Borel, its preimage under this measurable map would be
Borel too, contradicting the hypothesis on `A`. -/

/-- For `A` non-Borel, the singleton bad event is non-Borel. Combine
`singleton_badEvent_eq_preimage_planar` with `planarWitnessEvent_not_measurable`: the
preimage of a non-Borel set under a measurable *surjection* cannot itself be Borel. -/

/-! ## Theorem L: Relative separation theorem -/

/-- **Main separation theorem.** Given any analytic non-Borel set `A ⊆ ℝ`, the
concept class obtained by parameterising `singletonConcept` (plus `zeroConcept`) over
`A` is a concrete witness that `WellBehavedVCMeasTarget` is strictly weaker than the
Krapp-Wirth Borel condition. The class is constructed as `Set.range e` for an
evaluation map `e : Bool × β → Concept ℝ Bool` built from a Polish parameterisation of
`A`; post-construction, `Set.range e` equals `singletonClassOn (Set.range g)` where `g`
realises `A`.

The class satisfies:

* `MeasurableHypotheses`: every individual hypothesis is Borel
  (`singletonClassOn_measurable`).
* `WellBehavedVCMeasTarget`: the bad event is analytic
  (`planarWitnessEvent_analytic` lifted via `singleton_badEvent_eq_preimage_planar`),
  hence `NullMeasurableSet` by the Choquet bridge.
* NOT `KrappWirthWellBehaved`: the bad event is not Borel
  (`singleton_badEvent_not_measurable`).

The separation is realised by passing through the standard Borel space ℝ as the
parameter space; the construction reuses no problem-specific fact beyond the existence
of an analytic non-Borel subset of ℝ (Souslin's classical result), supplied in
`exists_measTarget_separation`. The witness shows that the measurable-target variant
proved in this kernel is a genuine improvement over the existing literature, not a
restatement. -/
