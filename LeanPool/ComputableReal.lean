A framework for verified interval-Cauchy real arithmetic, after Russell O'Connor,
*Certified exact transcendental real number computation in Coq*, TPHOLs 2008
(doi:10.1007/978-3-540-71067-7_21, arXiv:0805.2438), which carries out the same program:
real numbers presented by converging rational approximations, verified bounds for
elementary functions, and comparisons reduced to interval evaluation. The reference
anchors the overall construction (`ComputableℝSeq`, the quotient field `Computableℝ`)
and the special-function bound sequences for `Real.sqrt`, `Real.exp`, and `Real.pi`.

A `ComputableℝSeq` is an arbitrary function `ℕ → ℚInterval` with proofs that the rational
endpoints converge to a common real value, so it is interval data, not an algorithm in the
computable-analysis sense. Ring arithmetic on sequences (and on the quotient field
`Computableℝ`) is executable interval arithmetic, and the rational bound functions for
`sqrt`/`exp` (`Sqrt.sqrtq`, `Exp.expLb`, `Exp.expUb`) are likewise executable. Comparison,
inversion, and the packaged special-function sequences extract sign information classically
and are `noncomputable`; the `Decidable` instances on comparisons carry no algorithmic
content.
