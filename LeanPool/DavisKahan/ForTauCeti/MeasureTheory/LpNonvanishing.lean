# A σ-finite measure carries a nowhere-vanishing `L²` function

On a σ-finite measure space there is an `F ∈ L²` with `F x ≠ 0` almost everywhere.

## Why it is wanted

In the multiplication model of spectral multiplicity theory, the scalar spectral measure of a
vector `F` is the pushforward of `|F|² · ρ`.  Such a measure is always dominated by the
pushforward of `ρ`; it is *equivalent* to it exactly when `F` is almost everywhere nonzero.  A
vector like that is what the classical development calls a **maximal vector**, and its existence
is what lets the measure class of the model be read off from a single vector.

σ-finiteness is exactly the right hypothesis, and it is used through
`MeasureTheory.exists_pos_lintegral_lt_of_sigmaFinite`: on a non-σ-finite space there need be no
integrable positive function at all, and hence no maximal vector.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_ae_ne_zero_memLp_two`: a nowhere-vanishing square-integrable function.
* `TauCeti.exists_ae_ne_zero_lp_two`: the same, as an element of `Lp ℂ 2 ρ`.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Extraction class: **authored in place** for the Tau Ceti staging layer.
* Spectra influence: **none** -- this module imports only Mathlib.

Take a positive integrable `w` from σ-finiteness and use its pointwise square root: squaring
turns the `L²` condition into the `L¹` condition that `w` already satisfies. -/
