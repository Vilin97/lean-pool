Staged for Tau Ceti, roadmap topic T19.  Mathlib is not the destination
(`ForTauCeti/README.md`); what follows is where this material would have gone on
the closed Mathlib track —
additions to
`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Typeclasses/Probability.lean`.

Formalized by Claude Fable 5 (claude-fable-5[1m]).

/-! # Measurability-free complement bound for probability measures

For a probability measure, `1 - μ sᶜ ≤ μ s` for an **arbitrary** set `s`.

Mathlib's `prob_compl_eq_one_sub₀` requires `NullMeasurableSet s` and
`prob_compl_le_one_sub_of_le_prob` requires `MeasurableSet s`; this lemma needs
nothing, because subadditivity `1 = μ (s ∪ sᶜ) ≤ μ s + μ sᶜ` holds for outer
measures.  This is the form in which high-probability events are consumed when
converting vanishing failure probabilities into convergence statements, where
the event sets are often not (easily) measurable.

For a probability measure, `1 - μ sᶜ ≤ μ s`, with no measurability assumption
on `s`: subadditivity gives `1 = μ (s ∪ sᶜ) ≤ μ s + μ sᶜ`.
