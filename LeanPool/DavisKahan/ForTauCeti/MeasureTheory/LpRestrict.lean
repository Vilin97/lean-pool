# `L²` of a measure splits over a countable measurable partition

Extension by zero,

```text
F ↦ s.indicator F,
```

is a linear isometry `L²(μ|_s) →ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(μ)` for every measurable `s`.  Over a countable
measurable partition of the space these isometries have pairwise orthogonal ranges spanning a
dense subspace, so

```text
L²(μ)  ≅  ⊕ₙ L²(μ|_{Bₙ})
```

as a Hilbert sum, and the isomorphism commutes with multiplication by any bounded measurable
symbol.

This is the one Hilbert-space step in the multiplicity construction.  Everything after it --
dominating a countable family of measures, passing to level sets, and rearranging the fibres --
is carried out on *measures*, where it is elementary, and transported back through this
decomposition together with the Radon--Nikodym unitary of
`ForTauCeti/MeasureTheory/RadonNikodymL2.lean` and the relabelling unitary of
`ForTauCeti/MeasureTheory/LpComp.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.extendLp`: the extension-by-zero isometry.
* `TauCeti.inner_extendLp_eq_zero_of_disjoint`: orthogonality of the ranges over disjoint sets.
* `TauCeti.isHilbertSum_extendLp`: **the decomposition**, as a `MeasureTheory.IsHilbertSum`.
* `TauCeti.extendLp_mulLp`: extension by zero intertwines the multiplication operators.

## Design notes

The analytic content is a single Mathlib lemma,
`MeasureTheory.eLpNorm_indicator_eq_eLpNorm_restrict`; everything else is bookkeeping about
almost-everywhere representatives.  Denseness is proved in the contrapositive -- the orthogonal
complement of the supremum of the ranges is trivial -- which avoids any summability argument:
a vector orthogonal to every range has zero restriction to every piece of the partition, hence
vanishes almost everywhere.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Extraction class: **authored in place** for the Tau Ceti staging layer.
* Spectra influence: **none** -- this module imports only Mathlib and `ForTauCeti`.
