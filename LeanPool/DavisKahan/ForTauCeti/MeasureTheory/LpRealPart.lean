# The `star`-fixed part of a complex `Lᵖ` space is the real `Lᵖ` space

Mathlib gives `Lp K p μ` a bare `Star` and an `InvolutiveStar` and nothing else: there is no
`StarAddMonoid (Lp K p μ)`, so `selfAdjoint (Lp K p μ)` is not even a legal expression, and no
comparison between `Lp ℝ p μ` and `Lp K p μ` exists at any level.  This module supplies the
comparison.

The content is that a `star`-fixed class is almost everywhere real, so it is the image of a real
class under pointwise `RCLike.ofReal`; the embedding is `ℝ`-linear and norm preserving because
`‖(r : K)‖ = |r|`.  The `ℝ` is not an artefact of the proof -- the `star`-fixed set is closed
under real scalars and *not* under `K`-scalars (multiply by `I`), so `ℝ`-linear is the strongest
statement available.

## The `star`-as-`compLp` trick

The awkward part is that `Lp` has no `StarAddMonoid`, so `star (F + G) = star F + star G` is not
available and cannot be quoted.  Rather than reprove each algebraic law from representatives,
`star_eq_compLp` identifies `star` on `Lp K p μ` with `ContinuousLinearMap.compLp` of the
`ℝ`-linear map `RCLike.conjCLE`.  Every additivity and real-homogeneity law then comes from
Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.add_compLp` and `ContinuousLinearMap.smul_compLp` for free, and
`starFixedSubmodule` can be built without a single further `Lp.ext`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ae_ofReal_re_eq_of_star_eq_self` and `TauCeti.star_eq_self_of_ae_ofReal_re_eq`:
  **C1**, the two directions of the a.e.-real characterisation.
* `TauCeti.star_eq_self_iff_ae_ofReal_re_eq` and `TauCeti.star_eq_self_iff_ae_im_eq_zero`: the
  biconditional, in the `ofReal ∘ re` and the `im = 0` phrasings.
* `TauCeti.ofRealLp` and `TauCeti.reLp`: **C2**, the two directions as maps, with
  `TauCeti.reLp_ofRealLp` and `TauCeti.ofRealLp_reLp_of_star_eq_self` inverse to each other.
* `TauCeti.ofRealLpₗᵢ`: **C3**, the embedding as an `ℝ`-linear isometry, with
  `TauCeti.range_ofRealLpₗᵢ` computing its range as `TauCeti.starFixedSubmodule`.
* `TauCeti.starFixedLpEquivRealLp`: the deliverable, `{F : Lp K p μ // star F = F} ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ]
  Lp ℝ p μ`.
