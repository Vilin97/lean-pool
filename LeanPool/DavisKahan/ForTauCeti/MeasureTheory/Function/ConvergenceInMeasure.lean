Staged for Tau Ceti, roadmap topic T19.  Mathlib is not the destination
(`ForTauCeti/README.md`); what follows is where this material would have gone on
the closed Mathlib track —
additions to
`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Function/ConvergenceInMeasure.lean`.

Formalized by Claude Fable 5 (claude-fable-5[1m]).

/-! # Convergence in measure from a vanishing high-probability rate

A standard way to consume concentration inequalities: if for each index `i` the
deviation `edist (f i x) (g x)` exceeds some deterministic `rate i` only on a
set of small measure, and `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in
measure.  This is how "with high probability, the error is at most `rate i`"
statements are converted into `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure`.

No measurability is required of the exceptional sets, since the squeeze only
uses monotonicity of the (outer) measure; the index runs along an arbitrary
filter, matching the generality of `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_edist`: the `edist`
  form, for an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued rate and a target with an extended distance.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_dist`: the `dist`
  form, for a real-valued rate and a pseudometric target.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_dist_le_rate`: the
  high-probability phrasing for a probability measure, with hypothesis
  `μ {x | dist (f i x) (g x) ≤ rate i} → 1`; here null-measurability of the
  good events is genuinely needed, since an outer measure can assign full
  measure to both a set and its complement.

If `f i` is within `rate i` of `g` outside a set whose measure tends to `0`,
and `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

This is the form in which concentration inequalities ("with high probability,
`edist (f i x) (g x) ≤ rate i`") are consumed.  No measurability of the
exceptional sets is needed: the proof only uses monotonicity of the measure.

If `f i` is within `rate i` of `g` outside a set whose measure tends to `0`,
and the real-valued `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

`dist` version of `tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_edist`; no
measurability of the exceptional sets is needed.

**High-probability phrasing.** If, for a probability measure, the events
"`f i` is within `rate i` of `g`" have probability tending to `1` and `rate`
tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

Unlike `tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_dist`, null-measurability
of the good events cannot be dropped here: an outer measure can assign measure
`1` to both a set and its complement, so `μ s → 1` alone says nothing about
`μ sᶜ`.
