# Composing `L²` classes with a measure-preserving map

For a measure-preserving `f : α → β` the map `F ↦ F ∘ f` is a linear isometry
`L²(ν) →ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(μ)`, and it **commutes with multiplication operators**: the symbol `G` on the
target becomes the symbol `G ∘ f` on the source.  When `f` has a measure-preserving
almost-everywhere inverse the isometry is a unitary.

Mathlib supplies the underlying additive map as `MeasureTheory.Lp.compMeasurePreserving`
together with `MeasureTheory.Lp.norm_compMeasurePreserving`; what is added here is the
`ℂ`-linear isometry packaging, the two-sided-inverse criterion, and the intertwining law with
`TauCeti.mulLp`.

## Why this is the shape spectral multiplicity theory needs

A multiplication model is a *measure* together with the coordinate symbol, so the two ways a
model can be changed without changing the operator are: replacing the measure by an equivalent
one (`ForTauCeti/MeasureTheory/RadonNikodymL2.lean`), and **relabelling the underlying space by
a measurable map that fixes the symbol**.  The second is this file.  Together they are exactly
the moves used to bring a direct sum of multiplication models into multiplicity normal form:
the relabelling permutes the fibres of the index coordinate and leaves the spectral coordinate
alone, so `G ∘ f = G` and the intertwining law becomes a plain commutation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.compLp`: the linear isometry `L²(ν) →ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(μ)`.
* `TauCeti.compLpEquiv`: the unitary, from a two-sided almost-everywhere inverse.
* `TauCeti.compLp_mulLp`: **the intertwining law**.
* `TauCeti.mulLp_congr_ae`: the multiplication operator only depends on the symbol almost
  everywhere -- needed because two models may present the same operator with symbols truncated
  at different bounds.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Extraction class: **authored in place** for the Tau Ceti staging layer.
* Spectra influence: **none** -- this module imports only Mathlib and `ForTauCeti`.

/-- **Transport along a measurable embedding.**  For a measurable embedding `e`, composition with
`e` is a unitary `L²(map e ρ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(ρ)`.

Injectivity is what makes it surjective: a square-integrable class on the source extends to the
target by `Function.extend`, measurably, because a measurable embedding carries measurable sets
to measurable sets.  This is the form used to move the scalar spectral measures off the
`spectrum` subtype and onto `ℂ`, where the models of two different operators can be compared. -/

/-- **Relabelling is `star`-equivariant.**  Composition acts on the argument and `star` acts on
the value, so the two commute with nothing to prove beyond moving the representatives past each
other.

This is what carries the real (`star`-fixed) part of an `L²` space along the relabelling step of
the multiplicity model: `TauCeti.starFixedSubmodule` is a `star`-fixed set, so an equivariant
isometry maps it into the corresponding one. -/
