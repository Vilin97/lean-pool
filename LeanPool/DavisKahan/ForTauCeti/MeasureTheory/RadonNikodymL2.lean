# The Radon--Nikodym unitary between the `L²` spaces of equivalent measures

For two σ-finite measures `μ ν` on a measurable space with `μ ≪ ν` and `ν ≪ μ`, the map

```text
f ↦ (x ↦ √((dμ/dν) x) * f x)
```

is a **unitary** `L²(μ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(ν)`, and it commutes with multiplication by any bounded
measurable function.  Together these say that the `L²` space of a measure, *together with its
multiplication operators*, depends only on the **measure class** of `μ` -- the equivalence class
of `μ` under mutual absolute continuity -- and not on `μ` itself.  That is exactly the
invariance that makes measure class, rather than measure, the datum in spectral multiplicity
theory.

The mathematical crux is the change of variables

```text
∫⁻ x, ‖√((dμ/dν) x) * f x‖ₑ² ∂ν = ∫⁻ x, (dμ/dν) x * ‖f x‖ₑ² ∂ν = ∫⁻ x, ‖f x‖ₑ² ∂μ,
```

whose second step is `MeasureTheory.lintegral_rnDeriv_mul` and whose first step is the pointwise
identity `‖√((dμ/dν) x)‖ₑ² = (dμ/dν) x`, valid wherever the derivative is finite -- which is
`ν`-almost everywhere by `Measure.rnDeriv_lt_top`.  Only `μ ≪ ν` is needed for that; the reverse
absolute continuity `ν ≪ μ` enters twice, to move `ν`-a.e. statements to `μ`-a.e. ones and to
make the map invertible, its inverse being the same construction with `dν/dμ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.rnDerivSqrt`: the multiplier `x ↦ √((dμ/dν) x)`, as a real-valued function.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_enorm_rnDerivSqrt_mul_sq`: **the change of variables**, in `ℝ≥0∞`-integral
  form.
* `TauCeti.eLpNorm_rnDerivSqrt_mul`: the same, as an equality of `L²` seminorms.
* `TauCeti.rnDerivL2`: the linear isometry `L²(μ) →ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(ν)`.
* `TauCeti.rnDerivL2_rnDerivL2`: the two isometries, for `dμ/dν` and for `dν/dμ`, are mutually
  inverse.
* `TauCeti.rnDerivL2Equiv`: **the Radon--Nikodym unitary** `L²(μ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(ν)`.
* `TauCeti.mulLp`: multiplication by a bounded measurable function, as a bounded operator on
  `L²`.
* `TauCeti.rnDerivL2Equiv_mulLp`: **the intertwining law** -- the unitary carries multiplication
  by `g` on `L²(μ)` to multiplication by the same `g` on `L²(ν)`.
* `TauCeti.mulLp_eq_conj_rnDerivL2`: the same, as an equality of bounded operators -- the two
  multiplication operators are unitarily equivalent.

## Design notes

**No separability, and no second countability.**  Nothing here constrains the measurable space,
so the result applies verbatim to the uniform-multiplicity decomposition of
the uniform-multiplicity decomposition, were it indexed by cardinals rather than by
`ℕ`.  The hypotheses are `SigmaFinite` on both measures, which is what
`Measure.HaveLebesgueDecomposition` and `Measure.rnDeriv_lt_top` need; finite measures -- in
particular the scalar spectral measures of the Borel calculus -- satisfy it by instance.

The multiplier is carried as a *real* function `rnDerivSqrt` and coerced into `ℂ` at each use.
That keeps `Real.sqrt`'s API (`Real.sq_sqrt`, `Real.sqrt_mul`) directly available, and it makes
the inverse identity `√(dμ/dν) * √(dν/dμ) = 1` a statement about real numbers.

/-- **The multiplier of the Radon--Nikodym unitary**: the pointwise square root of the
Radon--Nikodym derivative `dμ/dν`, as a real-valued function.

`Measure.rnDeriv` is `ℝ≥0∞`-valued, so this takes `.toReal` first.  That is harmless: the
derivative is finite `ν`-almost everywhere (`Measure.rnDeriv_lt_top`), and every statement below
is an almost-everywhere one. -/

/-- **The pointwise identity behind the change of variables.**  Squaring the multiplier, in
`ℝ≥0∞`, returns the Radon--Nikodym derivative -- wherever that derivative is finite.

Finiteness is not decoration: `∞.toReal = 0`, so on a set where `dμ/dν = ∞` the multiplier would
vanish and the identity would fail. -/

is what makes the Radon--Nikodym isometry invertible.  Only `ν ≪ μ` is needed. -/

/-- **The intertwining law for the Radon--Nikodym unitary.**  Under the unitary
`L²(μ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] L²(ν)`, multiplication by a bounded measurable `g` on `L²(μ)` corresponds to
multiplication by the *same* `g` on `L²(ν)`.

Together with `rnDerivL2Equiv` this is the statement that a multiplication model is an invariant
of the measure *class*: two multiplication operators built from equivalent measures and the same
symbol are unitarily equivalent. -/

/-- **The two multiplication operators are unitarily equivalent.**  Conjugating multiplication by
`g` on `L²(μ)` by the Radon--Nikodym unitary -- whose inverse is the isometry of the reversed
pair -- returns multiplication by the same `g` on `L²(ν)`.

This is the form the multiplicity theory consumes: two multiplication models built from
*equivalent* measures and the same symbol define unitarily equivalent operators, so the invariant
carried by a model is the measure class, not the measure. -/
