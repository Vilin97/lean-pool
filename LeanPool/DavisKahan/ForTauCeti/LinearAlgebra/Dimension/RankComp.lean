# Natural-number rank bounds for composites

Mathlib bounds the rank of a composite by the rank of either factor, but only
`LinearMap.rank_comp_le_left` is universe-monomorphic: the bound by the *right*
(inner) factor compares ranks living in the domain and codomain universes, so
Mathlib states it as `LinearMap.lift_rank_comp_le_right`, through
`Cardinal.lift`.

Whenever the bound is a natural number that lift is invisible
(`Cardinal.lift_le_natCast`), and a natural-number bound is all any
finite-rank-approximation argument ever propagates.  This module records the
resulting two lemmas — one per factor — and their `ContinuousLinearMap`
specializations, which is what lets rank bounds be transported across the
independent source and target universes of a `ContinuousLinearMap`.

## Main declarations

* `LinearMap.rank_comp_le_natCast_right`: the cross-universe bound, the reason
  this module exists.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.rank_comp_le_left`,
  `ContinuousLinearMap.rank_comp_le_natCast_right`: the continuous
  specializations, stated so that `(f ∘L g).rank` needs no unfolding at the
  call site.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original declarations: `ContinuousLinearMap.rank_comp_left_le_of_rank_le` and
  the private `ContinuousLinearMap.rank_comp_right_le_rank`, both stated inside
  `ForTauCeti/Analysis/OperatorIdeal/ApproximationNumber/Basic.lean` (itself
  adapted from Mathlib PR #32126).
* Extraction class: **moved and generalized.**  The signature-polish backlog
  flagged the public one as rank plumbing shipped inside an operator-ideal
  file, dispositioned "privatize or reuse".  Privatizing is not available —
  it has independent consumers in three `DavisKahan` modules and in a
  sibling `ApproximationNumber` module — so it takes the other route already
  used for `Cardinal.lift_le_natCast`: state the
  mathematics where it belongs, in its own dependency-closed module, and leave
  the operator-ideal PR carrying no rank API.  The `LinearMap` statement is new;
  it is the content, and the continuous versions are one-line specializations.
* Upstream targets are two different files, hence the two namespaces here:
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/LinearMap.lean` for the `LinearMap` lemma,
  next to `lift_rank_comp_le_right`, and a topology-side file for the
  `ContinuousLinearMap` ones.
* Spectra influence: **none** — this module imports only Mathlib.

/-- A natural-number bound on the rank of the inner factor bounds the rank of a
composite, across independent universes.

This is `LinearMap.lift_rank_comp_le_right` with the lift discharged: the two
ranks live in different universes, but a natural-number bound does not
(`Cardinal.lift_le_natCast`).  Compare `LinearMap.rank_comp_le_right`, which
gets rid of the lift instead by forcing the outer codomain into the domain's
universe. -/
