# Operator ideal families

An **operator ideal** in the sense of Pietsch is a rule assigning to every pair
of spaces `E`, `F` a linear subspace of `E →L[𝕜] F` that is stable under
composition with arbitrary bounded maps on either side, together with a norm on
that subspace dominating the operator norm and submultiplicative against outer
compositions.  Because Davis--Kahan compares operators *between different
spaces*, the ideal must be handled as a coherent family across all pairs at
once, not as a norm on a single endomorphism algebra.

The families here range over **Hilbert** spaces, with source and target still in
independent universes.  See "Why Hilbert and not Banach" below: the restriction
is forced by the examples, not by the laws.

## The single-field representation

The family is presented by exactly one datum, an extended-real-valued **gauge**

```
gauge : (E →L[𝕜] F) → ℝ≥0∞
```

defined on *all* operators, with the ideal recovered as its finiteness domain
`OperatorIdealFamily.carrier`.  This is the classical presentation of a symmetric
norming function (Gohberg--Krein): an operator lies in the ideal exactly when its
ideal norm is finite.  Three things follow.

* **Extensionality is structural.**  Two families with the same gauge are equal
  (`OperatorIdealFamily.ext`), because the gauge is the only field.  A
  representation carrying membership and a gauge as *independent* data cannot
  have such a theorem: the gauge is then unconstrained off the ideal, so two
  families can agree on every ideal element and still differ.
* **Every law is unconditional.**  In `ℝ≥0∞` the triangle inequality, the
  homogeneity `gauge (c • A) = ‖c‖ₑ * gauge A`, and the ideal bound
  `gauge (L ∘L A ∘L R) ≤ ‖L‖ₑ * gauge A * ‖R‖ₑ` all hold verbatim at
  non-members, so no law needs a membership hypothesis and no lemma needs to
  carry one.
* **The axiom list is short.**  Four laws suffice.  Closure of the ideal under
  `0`, `+`, `•`, `-`, and finite sums is a *consequence* (it is
  `Submodule` membership for `carrier`), `gauge 0 = 0` follows from homogeneity
  at `c = 0`, and definiteness follows from `enorm_le_gauge`.

## Why Hilbert and not Banach

The four laws are statements about a norm, and every one of them is meaningful
verbatim for Banach `E`, `F`.  The *examples* are not.  Of the five gauges this
development has — the operator norm, the finite Ky Fan gauges, Schatten `p`,
trace class and Hilbert--Schmidt — only the first survives outside Hilbert
space, and the obstruction is `gauge_add_le`, not the definition.  Concretely,
for the finite Ky Fan gauge `∑_{n < k} aₙ(A)` the *gauge* is defined at full
Banach generality (`ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber` is stated for
seminormed spaces over a `NontriviallyNormedField`) while its subadditivity is
Hilbertian: the proof runs through singular values and majorization, and the
classical additivity of approximation numbers,
`a_{m+n}(S + T) ≤ aₘ(S) + aₙ(T)`, does **not** recover it — already at `k = 2`
that bound only gives `a₀(S) + 2a₀(T) + a₁(S)`, which is not
`∑_{n<2} aₙ(S) + ∑_{n<2} aₙ(T)`.

So a Banach-wide version of this structure would be a notion with one instance
and no way to acquire the motivating ones.  The parameters are therefore Hilbert
throughout.  Re-widening is a purely mechanical edit should an instance ever
appear: no proof in this file uses the inner product, only the norm.

## Layering

`OperatorIdealFamily` keeps **independent source and target universes**.  Adjoint
symmetry cannot be added at that generality: `A✝` swaps the roles of source and
target, so a family closed under adjoints must be defined on a single universe.
That is `SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily`, which extends the diagonal
instantiation.

The two universes occur only through `max v w` in the type of the structure
itself, so `linter.checkUnivs` flags them.  **They stay independent, and the
argument is the layering itself rather than an appeal to generality**:

* `SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily` extends `OperatorIdealFamily.{u, v, v}` — it
  *is* the diagonal instantiation.  Collapse `v` and `w` and `.{u, v, v}` becomes
  `.{u, v}`: the two structures acquire the same generality, and the distinction
  this section is about stops existing.  The rectangular layer earns its second
  universe by being the thing the symmetric layer specializes.
* `Family/OperatorNorm.lean` carries a hand-written specialization of
  `instIsCompleteOperatorNormIdealFamily` precisely because the general instance
  is stated at three independent universes and instance search cannot see it once
  the symmetric family equates the last two.

So the independence is exercised, not merely declared; the linter's heuristic
reads the structure's type, where it is invisible.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.OperatorIdealFamily`: the gauge and its four laws.
* `TauCeti.OperatorIdealFamily.carrier`: the ideal, as a `Submodule`.
* `TauCeti.OperatorIdealFamily.Elem`: the ideal as a normed space in its own
  right — a type synonym for the carrier carrying the *ideal* norm rather than
  the operator norm inherited from the ambient space.
* `TauCeti.OperatorIdealFamily.IsComplete`: completeness of the ideal, expressed
  as `CompleteSpace` for that norm rather than as a hand-rolled Cauchy criterion.
* `TauCeti.SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily`: the adjoint-invariant diagonal layer.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: `DavisKahan/OperatorIdeal/UnitarilyInvariant/RectangularFamily.lean`
  (`RectangularSymmetricIdealFamily`, Jon Crall / OpenAI GPT-5.6 Thinking); Apache 2.0.
* Extraction class: **redesigned**.  Per the signature-polish backlog the free-data presentation
  (`Mem` plus a total real gauge constrained only on members, one universe,
  hand-rolled completeness, fourteen fields) is replaced here by the
  single-gauge presentation above, and this is the only presentation of an
  operator ideal in the library.  The legacy structure was retired downstream on
  2026-08-27, together with both directions of the conversion between the two and
  the four concrete ideals that were built by converting a canonical family into a
  legacy record and back.  Its free data survives only as
  `SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily.Core` in
  `DavisKahan/OperatorIdeal/UnitarilyInvariant/FamilyCore.lean`: constructor
  arguments for `ofCore`, carrying no gauge of their own and used by the two
  source-facing Hilbert--Schmidt ideals, which are families from the moment they
  are defined.

-- it exists because instance search cannot find the three-universe instance once the

already inherits the *operator* norm from `E →L[𝕜] F`, and the two norms differ.

**`@[expose]`, and this is the one place in the group that needs it.**  `Elem` is
a *type*: the compiler has to see that it is a subtype in order to infer the same
representation for `Elem.val` and `Elem.mk` here as in any consuming module, and
it says so — *"locally inferred compilation type differs from type that would be
inferred in other modules"*.  That is not the `api-design` rubric's
expose-instead-of-a-lemma anti-pattern, which is about proofs relying on defeq;
no lemma can substitute for a type's representation.

/-- **A gauge-Cauchy sequence is operator-norm Cauchy**, because the ideal norm
dominates the operator norm.

This is the first step of every `IsComplete` proof: get a limit in the ambient
bounded operators, then show it stays in the ideal.  It was written out
identically in all four of `HilbertSchmidt`, `KyFan`, `Schatten` and
`TraceClass`, three of them character for character. -/

for `E →L[𝕜] F`: an ideal norm cannot repair an incomplete target. -/

/-- **Block sums: the gauge is squeezed between the maximum and the sum of the
two block gauges.**

For an operator split as `T = Q₁ T P₁ + Q₂ T P₂` with all four factors
contractive — the shape a block-diagonal decomposition of source and target
produces.

**Both halves are formal from the family laws.**  The upper bound is
`gauge_add_le` on the splitting; the lower is `gauge_comp_le`, the two-sided
ideal law, with the contractivity hypotheses collapsing `‖Q‖ₑ * · * ‖P‖ₑ` to `·`.
No approximation-number reasoning enters.

The *general* block statement — that the approximation-number sequence of a
block-diagonal sum is the decreasing rearrangement of the union of the summands'
sequences — is genuinely harder and is **not** what this needs; anyone reaching
for a rearrangement theorem here is solving the wrong problem. -/
