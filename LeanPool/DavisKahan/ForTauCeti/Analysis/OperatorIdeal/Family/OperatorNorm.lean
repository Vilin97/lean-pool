# The operator norm as an ideal family

The largest operator ideal is the whole space of bounded operators, gauged by
the operator norm.  It is the canonical example of
`TauCeti.OperatorIdealFamily`, and — since the adjoint is an isometry — of
`TauCeti.SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily`.

This module also records the two facts that make the example useful as a
sanity check on the abstract layer: the ideal is everything
(`carrier_operatorNormFamily`), and the ideal norm on it is the operator norm
(`operatorNormFamilyElemEquiv`, a linear isometry equivalence onto
`E →L[𝕜] F`), from which completeness of the family is inherited from
completeness of `E →L[𝕜] F`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.operatorNormIdealFamily`: the operator norm as an ideal family over a
  general nontrivially normed field, with independent source and target
  universes.
* `TauCeti.operatorNormFamily`: its symmetric (Hilbert, adjoint-invariant)
  refinement.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: authored directly in `ForTauCeti` at Davis--Kahan
  commit `b283d23`; it has had no prior home.
* Extraction class: **authored in place** for the Tau Ceti staging layer.
* Original authors / copyright: Jon Crall, Claude Opus 5, OpenAI GPT-5.6 Thinking; Copyright (c)
  2026 Kitware, Inc.;
  Apache 2.0.
* Spectra influence: **none** — this module imports only Mathlib and sibling
  `ForTauCeti` staging modules.

/-- Submultiplicativity of the operator norm across a **two-sided** composition.

Mathlib has the two-fold `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm_comp_le`; the two-sided
form is what every ideal law is stated against, so it is worth a name.  Nothing
here needs an inner product or completeness — it is a fact about normed spaces
— but it is stated where its first consumer is rather than in a file of its own.
