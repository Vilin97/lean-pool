Staged for Tau Ceti, roadmap topic T09, Milestone A3.  Mathlib is not the
destination (`ForTauCeti/README.md`); what follows is where this material would
have gone on the closed Mathlib track — addition to
`Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/`, alongside the orthogonal projection.

# Compact operators into a Hilbert space are approximable

The last edge of the approximable/compact boundary: a compact operator whose
**target** is a Hilbert space has `aₙ(T) → 0`.  The other three edges are
elsewhere in this directory — the characterisation of `aₙ(T) → 0` as
finite-rank approximability, and approximable ⇒ compact — and the four together
say that on a Hilbert target, compactness *is* the vanishing of the
approximation numbers.

* `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_rank_le_natCast_norm_sub_le_of_isCompactOperator`:
  the quantitative form — a compact operator is within `ε` of an operator of
  finite rank, for every `ε > 0`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.tendsto_approximationNumber_atTop_nhds_zero_of_isCompactOperator`:
  the roadmap statement, `aₙ(T) → 0`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.isCompactOperator_iff_tendsto_approximationNumber`: the
  boundary as a single equivalence, on a complete Hilbert target.

## The hypothesis is on the target, not on the pair

The roadmap asks for compact operators *between* Hilbert spaces.  What the proof
uses is an orthogonal projection onto a finite-dimensional subspace of the
**codomain**, so the domain `E` is an arbitrary normed space over `𝕜` and only
`F` carries an inner product.  Stating it that way is not a speculative
generalisation: it is what the argument proves, and the asymmetry is the content
— the counterexamples that make *compact ⇒ approximable* false in general are
about the target's approximation property, so this is where the Hilbert
hypothesis has to sit.  A reader who wants the roadmap's symmetric statement
gets it by instantiating `E`.

**Completeness of `F` is not needed either**, and is deliberately absent from the
first two results: a finite-dimensional subspace of an inner-product space is
complete on its own, which is what makes its orthogonal projection exist.  Only
the reverse implication of the final equivalence needs `[CompleteSpace F]`, for
Mathlib's closure argument.

## The proof

Total boundedness, not the spectral theorem.  A compact `T` sends the closed unit
ball into a totally bounded set, so for `ε > 0` finitely many `ε`-balls centred at
points `y ∈ s` cover its image; let `P` be the orthogonal projection onto
`span 𝕜 s`, which is finite-dimensional.  For a unit vector `x`, the point `P (T x)`
is the nearest point of the span to `T x` (`Submodule.starProjection_minimal`) and
some `y ∈ s` is within `ε`, so `‖T x - P (T x)‖ ≤ ε`; hence `‖T - P ∘L T‖ ≤ ε` and
`P ∘L T` has rank at most `finrank 𝕜 (span 𝕜 s)`.

The spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators applied to `T⋆T` is the
textbook route and was the predicted one; it proves a strictly weaker statement
(it needs both spaces to be Hilbert, and `F` complete) through a much larger
prerequisite.  The nearest-point argument is recorded here because it is the one
that fits the API this directory already has.

## Sources

*Follows nothing in particular*: the finite-`ε`-net argument is the standard
textbook proof that a Hilbert space has the approximation property, specialised
to what the approximation-number API needs.

/-- **A compact operator into a Hilbert space is uniformly approximable by
operators of finite rank.**  For every `ε > 0` there is an `R` of rank at most
some `n` with `‖T - R‖ ≤ ε`.

The rank bound is delivered as `R.rank ≤ (n : Cardinal)` with `n` existentially
quantified, which is the shape `approximationNumber_le_norm_sub` consumes; the
value of `n` is `finrank 𝕜` of the span of an `ε`-net of `T '' closedBall 0 1`,
and no statement downstream depends on which `n` it is. -/

/-- **A compact operator into a Hilbert space has vanishing approximation
numbers.**  This is the roadmap's Milestone A3 and the last of the four edges of
the approximable/compact boundary.

Given `ε > 0`, the previous theorem supplies an `R` of rank at most `n` with
`‖T - R‖ ≤ ε / 2`; every index `m ≥ n` then admits `R` as a competitor, so
`aₘ(T) ≤ ε / 2 < ε`.  Antitonicity of `aₙ` is not needed — the rank bound
`R.rank ≤ n ≤ m` is what makes `R` admissible at `m`. -/

/-- **On a complete Hilbert target, compactness is the vanishing of the approximation
numbers.**  Both implications are in this directory; the equivalence is stated because
it is the boundary the roadmap describes, and reading it off the two halves requires
knowing that the hypotheses line up.

`[CompleteSpace F]` is used only by the reverse implication, through Mathlib's closure
argument for compact operators; the forward implication needs neither it nor an inner
product on the domain. -/
