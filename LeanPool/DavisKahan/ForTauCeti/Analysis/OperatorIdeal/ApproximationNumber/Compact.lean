# Approximation numbers, finite-rank approximability, and compactness

Staged for Tau Ceti, roadmap topic T09.  The boundary §A4 of that roadmap asks
for: an operator's approximation numbers tend to zero exactly when it is a norm
limit of finite-rank operators, and such an operator is compact.

* `tendsto_approximationNumber_atTop_iff_exists_finiteRank_approx` — the
  characterisation, stated **directly as a sequence of finite-rank operators**.
  The roadmap rules out a named `ApproximableOperator` predicate until multiple
  consumers justify one, so there is no new definition here.
* `isCompactOperator_of_tendsto_approximationNumber` — approximation numbers
  tending to zero force compactness, unconditionally over a proper scalar field.
  The closure argument is Mathlib's (`isCompactOperator_of_tendsto`) and the
  approximating sequence is the one above.  **The finite-rank input used to be an
  explicit hypothesis**, because Mathlib has no *finite rank ⇒ compact* lemma;
  it is now `ContinuousLinearMap.isCompactOperator_of_rank_lt_aleph0` in
  `ForTauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Operator/FiniteRankCompact.lean`, written there
  rather than here because it is a general fact about compact operators and has
  nothing to do with operator ideals — which is what this docstring previously
  said should happen.

**The converse over a general Banach space is deliberately absent.**  A compact
operator between Banach spaces need not be a norm limit of finite-rank operators
without an approximation-property hypothesis, so the implication
*compact ⇒ `aₙ → 0`* belongs to the Hilbert-space development and is not stated
here.  Recording that in this docstring rather than proving a false generalisation
is the point.

## Sources

*Follows nothing in particular*: the statements are the standard finite-rank
approximation boundary, and the proofs go through this library's own
approximation-number API and Mathlib's compact-operator closure lemma.

/-- **Approximable operators are compact.**  This is the implication roadmap
topic T09 §A4 asks for: `aₙ(T) → 0` forces `T` compact.

The argument is two Mathlib-shaped halves.  The approximating sequence is
`tendsto_approximationNumber_atTop_iff_exists_finiteRank_approx`, and the closure
step is Mathlib's `isCompactOperator_of_tendsto`; what sits between them is that
each `R n` is compact, which is
`ContinuousLinearMap.isCompactOperator_of_rank_lt_aleph0`.

**That last lemma is not Mathlib's** — Mathlib has no *finite rank ⇒ compact*
statement — so it is proved in
`ForTauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Operator/FiniteRankCompact.lean`, a module about
compact operators, rather than here.  An earlier version of this theorem carried
it as an explicit hypothesis with a docstring saying exactly that it should move;
it has moved.

`[ProperSpace 𝕜]` is what the finite-rank lemma needs, and it is the only new
scalar hypothesis.  Completeness of `F` is Mathlib's, for the closure step. -/
