# Approximation numbers of bounded operators

The **zero-based** approximation number of a continuous linear map `T` at index
`n` is the operator-norm distance from `T` to continuous linear maps of rank
**at most** `n`.  This file develops its elementary order and ideal API over an
arbitrary nontrivially normed field, with independent source and target
universes.

The declarations here deliberately stop before Hilbert-space-specific results:
adjoint invariance, finite-dimensional singular-value identification, and
infinite-dimensional min--max lower bounds live in sibling modules.

## The index convention

The operator-ideal literature is split.  Pietsch's `s`-numbers are one-based,
`sₙ(T) = dist(T, {rank < n})` with `s₁(T) = ‖T‖`; here `aₙ(T)` is zero-based,
`aₙ(T) = dist(T, {rank ≤ n})` with `a₀(T) = ‖T‖`, so `sₙ = a_{n-1}`.  Only one
of the two is developed — carrying both would duplicate the whole API for an
index shift — and the zero-based one is chosen because every downstream
statement is off-by-one free in it:

* the additive ideal inequality is `a_{m+n}(S + T) ≤ aₘ(S) + aₙ(T)`
  (`ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_add_le`), against the one-based
  `s_{m+n-1}`;
* the singular-value identification is `aₙ(T) = σₙ(T)`
  (`ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_eq_singularValues`), a genuine
  identity of indices, because Mathlib's `LinearMap.singularValues` is itself
  zero-indexed; one-based numbering would put an `n - 1` — truncated
  subtraction — into the flagship theorem of the development;
* `a₀(T) = ‖T‖` needs no convention at `n = 0`, whereas the one-based `s₀` has
  to be defined by fiat.

The convention is stated in the first sentence of the definition's docstring
and is recorded as decision 1 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/OperatorTheory/OperatorIdeals/README.md` (Part A generality bar).

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber`: the `n`th zero-based approximation
  number, valued in `ℝ`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_le_norm_sub` and
  `ContinuousLinearMap.le_approximationNumber_iff`: the characteristic upper and
  lower bounds.  Together they replace unfolding the definition; the defining
  infimum itself is available as
  `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_eq_iInf`, which is deliberately not a
  `simp` lemma.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_index_zero`: the **zeroth**
  approximation number is the operator norm.  The index, not the operator, is
  what is zero here; `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_zero` is the
  companion statement about the zero operator, matching Mathlib's
  `LinearMap.singularValues_zero`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_antitone`: approximation numbers
  decrease with the allowed rank.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_add_le`,
  `approximationNumber_comp_le_norm_mul`, `approximationNumber_comp_le_mul_norm`,
  `approximationNumber_comp_comp_le`: the additive and two-sided ideal
  inequalities.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_comp_eq_of_leftInverse`: enlarging the
  codomain along a contraction with a contractive left inverse changes nothing.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_smul`: absolute homogeneity.

## Namespace note

These declarations extend the existing Mathlib namespace `ContinuousLinearMap`
rather than living under `TauCeti`, so that dot notation
(`T.approximationNumber`) resolves and the names match the eventual Mathlib
upstreaming target (adapted from Mathlib PR #32126). Lean field projection binds
`T.approximationNumber` only to the literal `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber`
and does not consult the enclosing `TauCeti` namespace. This is a deliberate API
choice, flagged for Tau Ceti maintainer review.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: `ForMathlib/Analysis/Normed/Operator/ApproximationNumber.lean`
  at Davis--Kahan commit `fc38eb48b9b49f2e1d87fe0c7022dc5e262820a7`.
* Original declarations: `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber` and the order
  and ideal API in the same namespace, plus two pieces of plumbing that have
  since moved out so that this module carries approximation-number API and
  nothing else: the universe helper `Cardinal.le_natCast_of_lift_le` (now the iff
  `Cardinal.lift_le_natCast` in `ForTauCeti/SetTheory/Cardinal/Lift.lean`) and
  the rank-of-composition bounds `rank_comp_left_le_of_rank_le` and
  `rank_comp_right_le_rank` (now `ContinuousLinearMap.rank_comp_le_natCast_right`
  and `ContinuousLinearMap.rank_comp_le_left` in
  `ForTauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/RankComp.lean`, generalized to
  `LinearMap`).
* Original authors / copyright: Jon Crall, OpenAI GPT-5.6 Thinking, Niels Voss,
  Arnav Mehta, Rawad Kansoh; Copyright (c) 2026 Kitware, Inc.; Apache 2.0.
* The Davis--Kahan file was itself adapted from Mathlib PR #32126.
* Extraction class: **copied**, converted to the Tau Ceti module system, then
  renamed conclusion-outward per the signature-polish backlog
  No mathematical change; see Appendix A of that document for the name index.
* Spectra influence: **none** — this module has no Spectra dependency and never
  did; it imports only Mathlib.

This is the first of the four statements roadmap topic T09 §A4 asks for.  It holds
over any normed pair — no inner product, no completeness, no finite dimension —
because `R := T` is admissible in the defining infimum.  The converse for a finite-dimensional
source over a complete field is proved in
`ApproximationNumber.Rank` as `approximationNumber_eq_zero_iff_rank_le`;
it does not require an inner product. -/

/-- **Composition multiplicativity across indices**: `a_{m+n}(S ∘ T) ≤ aₘ(S) · aₙ(T)`.

The name carries `add` deliberately.  `approximationNumber_comp_comp_le` is the *two-sided ideal*
bound `aₙ(L ∘ T ∘ R) ≤ ‖L‖ · aₙ(T) · ‖R‖`, a different theorem at a fixed index; this one splits
the index, which is what makes the approximation numbers behave like a multiplicative scale and is
the input to the Schatten Hölder inequalities.

The approximant is `R₁ ∘ T + (S - R₁) ∘ R₂`, whose rank is at most `m + n` because each summand is
bounded by the rank of *its own* finite-rank factor — the left one by `R₁`, the right one by `R₂`.
The residual then factors as `(S - R₁) ∘ (T - R₂)`, so the two approximation errors multiply. -/

/-- **Approximation numbers do not see an enlargement of the codomain.**

`ι` embeds `F` into `G` with `‖ι‖ ≤ 1`, and `π` is a left inverse with `‖π‖ ≤ 1`; the
model is the inclusion of `F` as one summand of an `ℓ²` direct sum together with the
projection back onto it.  Postcomposing with `ι` then leaves every approximation number
where it was, because both ideal inequalities apply and `π ∘ ι = id` closes the loop.
(The two hypotheses force `ι` to be isometric: `‖y‖ = ‖π (ι y)‖ ≤ ‖ι y‖ ≤ ‖y‖`.)

Nothing here needs an inner product, completeness, or a bound on any dimension.  Its use
is to move an operator into a codomain with room for as many orthonormal vectors as an
argument needs, without changing the quantity being computed. -/
