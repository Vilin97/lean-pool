# The resolvent set of an unbounded operator

Mathlib's `resolventSet` and `resolvent` are Banach-algebra notions: they ask that
`algebraMap 𝕜 A r - a` be a *unit* of the algebra, which only makes sense for an element `a`
of that algebra. The infinitesimal generator of a C₀-semigroup is not such an element — it is
an unbounded operator, carried here by `LinearPMap` — so it needs its own resolvent notion.

This file supplies it. For `A : E →ₗ.[𝕜] E` and `lambda : 𝕜` we say that a *bounded* operator
`R : E →L[𝕜] E` is a resolvent of `A` at `lambda` (`TauCeti.LinearPMap.IsResolventAt`)
when `R` takes values in `D(A)` and is a two-sided inverse of `lambda • I - A : D(A) → E`. Such
an `R` is unique when it exists, so the *resolvent set*
`TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolventSet` and the *resolvent*
`TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolvent` are well defined, and the resolvent obeys the usual
identities.

Nothing here mentions semigroups: the theory is stated for an arbitrary `A : E →ₗ.[𝕜] E`, which
is what makes it usable for an operator not yet known to generate anything — the situation of
the Hille--Yosida generation theorem, whose hypotheses read `(ω, ∞) ⊆ resolventSet A` together
with a bound on `‖resolvent A l ^ n‖`.

Two bridges keep this from being a parallel universe.

* **To Mathlib's bounded notion.** A bounded operator `T : E →L[𝕜] E`, read as the everywhere
  defined unbounded operator `(T : E →ₗ[𝕜] E).toPMap ⊤`, has exactly Mathlib's resolvent set
  and resolvent (`TauCeti.LinearPMap.mem_resolventSet_toPMap_top_iff`,
  `TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolvent_toPMap_top`), proved here. Mathlib's
  `_root_.resolventSet 𝕜 T` is `IsUnit (algebraMap 𝕜 _ lambda - T)`, so the two use the same
  `lambda • I - T` convention and the bridge is a genuine identification, not a sign flip.
* **To the Laplace-transform resolvent.** For a C₀-semigroup `S` with growth bound `(ω, M)`,
  every `lambda > ω` lies in the resolvent set of the generator and the resolvent there *is*
  the Laplace transform `∫₀^∞ e^{-λt} S(t) x dt`. That bridge is a real-scalar statement and is
  proved downstream of Tau Ceti's semigroup theory, which then derives the semigroup resolvent
  identity from the abstract one below.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.IsResolventAt`: `R` inverts `lambda • I - A`.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolventSet`: the set of `lambda` at which such an `R` exists.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolvent`: that `R`, chosen by `Classical.choose`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.IsResolventAt.unique`: the inverse is unique, so the resolvent
  is well defined.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.eq_of_le_of_mem_resolventSet`: an operator has no proper extension
  sharing a resolvent point.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolvent_sub_resolvent`: the resolvent identity
  `R(lambda) - R(mu) = (mu - lambda) R(lambda) R(mu)`, and
  `TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolvent_comm`.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.mem_resolventSet_of_norm_mul_lt_one` and
  `TauCeti.LinearPMap.isOpen_resolventSet`: the Neumann-series perturbation of a
  resolvent point, and the openness of the resolvent set it gives.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.mem_resolventSet_toPMap_top_iff` and
  `TauCeti.LinearPMap.resolvent_toPMap_top`: the bounded bridge.

## Provenance

* **Original repository:** Tau Ceti, at the time checked in here as the `external/TauCeti`
  submodule build input, at commit `f6b7ee2e03b075c1a5a8bcbe0a67932442649b43`. That submodule
  was removed on 2026-08-28; Tau Ceti is now a pinned Lake dependency. The commit is the
  provenance datum and is unchanged.
* **Original module:** `TauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Operator/Resolvent/Unbounded.lean`. The
  generalization tracks upstream `main` at commit
  `1b39d420ac84ed9a5a7d536ce19b37818ad29c39`, which adds
  `TauCeti.LinearPMap.eq_of_le_of_mem_resolventSet` to the module as pinned; all thirty of that
  module's declarations appear below.
* **Original authors / copyright / licence:** Copyright (c) 2026 The Tau Ceti contributors;
  Apache 2.0. Apache 2.0 §4(b): the declarations below are **modified** — see "What changed".
  Apache 2.0 §4(c): the upstream notice is retained in the file header above.
* **Extraction class:** *generalized*. Every one of the upstream module's declarations appears
  here under the same name, with the same statement shape, over a general scalar field.
* **What changed:**
  * The scalar field is generalized from `ℝ` to `{𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜]`
    throughout; the carrier hypotheses become `[NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E]`.
    No declaration needs more than `NontriviallyNormedField`, so no `RCLike` assumption
    appears. The `lambda • I - A` convention, the `Classical.choose` totalization of
    `resolvent`, the junk value off the resolvent set, and the sign convention
    `R(lambda) - R(mu) = (mu - lambda) • R(lambda) R(mu)` are all kept exactly as upstream.
  * Two statements change shape because `|·|` is not available on a general field: the
    hypothesis of `TauCeti.LinearPMap.mem_resolventSet_of_norm_mul_lt_one` and of the private
    `exists_inverse_one_sub_smul_resolvent` reads `‖mu - lambda‖ * ‖resolvent A lambda‖ < 1`
    where upstream reads `|mu - lambda| * ‖resolvent A lambda‖ < 1`. Over `ℝ` the two agree,
    since `‖x‖ = |x|` for a real number, so this is a faithful generalization of the upstream
    hypothesis and not a strengthening.
  * The ambient space variable is spelled `E` rather than `X`, and the docstring reference to
    the downstream semigroup Laplace-transform bridge is described rather than named, since
    that bridge is a real-scalar result living in Tau Ceti's semigroup files.

/-! ## Inverting `lambda • I - A` -/

/-- `IsResolventAt A lambda R` says that the **bounded** operator `R : E →L[𝕜] E` inverts
`lambda • I - A : D(A) → E`: it takes its values in `D(A)`, is a right inverse of
`lambda • I - A` on all of `E`, and is a left inverse of it on `D(A)`.

For an unbounded `A` this replaces the Banach-algebra condition
`IsUnit (algebraMap 𝕜 (E →L[𝕜] E) lambda - A)` behind Mathlib's `resolventSet`, which cannot be
formed because `A` is not an element of `E →L[𝕜] E`. The two conditions agree when `A` is a
bounded operator read as an everywhere defined `LinearPMap`; see
`TauCeti.LinearPMap.mem_resolventSet_toPMap_top_iff`. -/

/-! ## The bridge to Mathlib's Banach-algebra resolvent

A bounded operator `T : E →L[𝕜] E` becomes an everywhere defined unbounded operator
`(T : E →ₗ[𝕜] E).toPMap ⊤`. Its resolvent set and resolvent in the sense above are Mathlib's
`resolventSet 𝕜 T` and `resolvent T`, computed in the Banach algebra `E →L[𝕜] E`. -/
