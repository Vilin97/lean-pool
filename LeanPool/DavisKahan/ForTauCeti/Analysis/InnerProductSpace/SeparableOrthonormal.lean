# Separability bounds the size of an orthonormal set

Two facts, in increasing specificity.

* `TauCeti.countable_of_pairwise_dist_le`: a uniformly separated set in a separable metric
  space is countable.
* `TauCeti.countable_of_orthonormal`: an orthonormal set in a separable inner
  product space is countable, because distinct orthonormal vectors are `√2` apart.

The second is the step Mathlib does not have, and it is the one a Hilbert-space classification
at separable scope needs first: it is what turns "the space is separable" into "the Hilbert
basis is indexed by a countable set", after which two infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert
spaces can be compared through `HilbertBasis.repr`.

Davis and Kahan work throughout on a separable Hilbert space, so this is the scope in which
their condition (3.5) -- equality of the Hilbert dimensions of two crossed defect spaces -- can
be connected to this repository's `CrossedDefectsEquivalent`, which asserts a linear isometric
equivalence.  In finite dimension the two readings are already proved equal
(`crossedDefectsEquivalent_iff_finrank_eq`); the separable infinite-dimensional half is what
remains, and it starts here.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Extraction class: **authored in place** for the Tau Ceti staging layer.
  `TauCeti.countable_of_pairwise_dist_le` was previously stated inside
  `ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/BorelCalculus/SeparableCyclic.lean`, which is a
  consumer rather than its owner; it moved here with its orthonormal corollary, and that module
  now imports this one.
* Spectra influence: **none** -- this module imports only Mathlib.

/-- **An orthonormal set in a separable inner product space is countable.**

Distinct orthonormal vectors are `√2 ≥ 1` apart, so the set is uniformly separated and
`TauCeti.countable_of_pairwise_dist_le` applies.  Mathlib proves that every Hilbert space has a
Hilbert basis but says nothing about its size; this is the missing step that makes "separable"
into "countably indexed". -/

/-! ## Separable Hilbert spaces are classified by the size of a Hilbert basis

Mathlib proves that every Hilbert space has a Hilbert basis (`exists_hilbertBasis`) but says
nothing about how large it is.  With `countable_of_orthonormal` the separable case is settled:
the index set is countable, so two separable Hilbert spaces whose bases are both countably
infinite are isometric, by `TauCeti.nonempty_linearIsometryEquiv_of_hilbertBasis` through the
`ℓ²` reindexing.

This is the half of Davis--Kahan's condition (3.5) that the finite-dimensional bridge
`crossedDefectsEquivalent_iff_finrank_eq` does not reach. -/

variable {F : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup F] [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 F]

/-- **A separable Hilbert space has a countably indexed Hilbert basis.**

`exists_hilbertBasis` produces one indexed by a set of vectors that is orthonormal; separability
makes that set countable. -/

  rwa [hb] at this

/-- **Two Hilbert spaces with countably infinite Hilbert bases are isometric.**

Two countably infinite index types are equinumerous, and the `ℓ²` reindexing carries one space
onto the other.  Separability enters through `exists_countable_hilbertBasis`, which is what
supplies `Countable` on the index; it is not needed again here. -/

/-- **Two separable Hilbert spaces with infinite Hilbert bases are isometric.**

The form the classification is actually used in: `exists_hilbertBasis` hands back a basis indexed
by an orthonormal *set* of vectors, so `hb` is the identification it comes with, separability
makes that set countable, and the hypothesis is only that it is infinite. -/

Through `lpPiLpₗᵢ`, the `ℓ²` model over a finite index is `PiLp 2` over that index, which is
finite-dimensional. -/

/-- **Any two infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces over the same field are
isometrically isomorphic.**

This is the classification the paper's separable scope permits, in the form Davis--Kahan's
condition (3.5) needs: the two crossed defect spaces have "the same Hilbert dimension" exactly
when they are both finite-dimensional of equal `finrank` or both infinite-dimensional, and in
the second case they are isometric with no further data.

The first case is `crossedDefectsEquivalent_iff_finrank_eq`; this is the second. -/
