Staged for Tau Ceti: additions to `Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/`
(a home next to `Submodule.starProjection`).

The quadratic-form identity
below had been proved four times: twice inside
`…/BoundedOperator/SinTheta.lean`'s `sinTheta_directed_coercive` and twice inside
`…/SinTheta/OperatorNorm.lean`'s `exists_isSymmetric_comp_sub_comp_eq`, at about
31 lines each.  Earlier consolidation reduced that to one private copy per
module; this module reduces it to one.

# Quadratic forms of reduced extensions

A *reduced extension* of an operator `R` along a subspace `W` is the operator
agreeing with `R` on `W` and acting as a real scalar `κ` on `Wᗮ`:

`R ∘ P_W + κ (1 - P_W)`.

It is the standard device for turning a *local* form bound — `R` is coercive on
`W`, or bounded above on `W` — into a *global* one, which is what a Sylvester
estimate consumes.  Davis–Kahan `sin Θ` proofs build two of them and need the
quadratic form of each.

The main result, `TauCeti.re_inner_reducedExtension_self`, computes that form:
the cross terms vanish by orthogonality, leaving

`re ⟪R (P x), P x⟫ + κ ‖x - P x‖²`.

## Design

The statement is about the **value** `R (P x) + κ • (x - P x)` rather than about
a bundled operator.  That is deliberate and it is what lets one lemma serve both
callers: one packages its extension as `E →L[𝕜] E` and needs no
finite-dimensionality, the other arrives with `R : E →ₗ[𝕜] E` and reaches
`E →L[𝕜] E` through `toContinuousLinearMap`, which does.  Phrased pointwise,
neither packaging appears, and the caller discharges the one-line `simp` that its
operator applied at `x` is that value.

Only **invariance** of `W` under `R` is assumed — not `Reduces`, and nothing
about `Wᗮ`.  That is all the argument uses.

## Sources

*Follows nothing in particular*: the identity is the standard orthogonal
splitting of a quadratic form, and the proof is Pythagoras plus the vanishing of
the cross terms.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: extracted from the bodies of
  `ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/BoundedOperator/SinTheta.lean`
  (`sinTheta_directed_coercive`) and
  `ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/SinTheta/OperatorNorm.lean`
  (`exists_isSymmetric_comp_sub_comp_eq`), where it had been proved four times
  inline.
* Extraction class: **de-duplicated in place** — no statement is new; the four
  inline copies become one named lemma and its two callers.
* Original authors / copyright: Jon Crall, Claude Opus 5; Copyright (c) 2026

* Spectra influence: **none** — imports only Mathlib.

Stated at the value `R (P x) + κ • (x - P x)` rather than at a bundled operator,

`simp`. -/
