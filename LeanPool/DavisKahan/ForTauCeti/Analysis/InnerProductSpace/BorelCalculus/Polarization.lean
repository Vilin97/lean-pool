# Polarised diagonal integrals

The bounded Borel functional calculus of a normal operator is built by
*polarising* the diagonal integrals of the previous module.  For a symbol
`f` and vectors `ψ, ξ` set

`pair f ψ ξ = ¼ Σ_{k<4} iᵏ ∫ f ∂(diagMeasure (ξ + iᵏ • ψ))`.

For **continuous** `f` this is exactly `⟪ψ, cfcHom f ξ⟫` (`pair_of_continuous`),
by the polarisation identity for the sesquilinear form of a bounded operator.
For a general bounded Borel `f` it is the definition of what
`⟪ψ, borelCalculus f ξ⟫` *ought* to be, and the next module shows it really is
the matrix element of an operator.

## The transport principle

Every algebraic identity satisfied by `pair` on continuous symbols transports to
bounded Borel symbols by a single mechanism, isolated here as
`norm_pair_sub_pair_le`: the difference of two `pair`s at the same pair of
vectors is bounded by the `L¹` distance of the symbols measured against *any*
finite measure dominating the four diagonal measures involved.  Since an
identity only ever involves finitely many vectors, one takes the (finite) sum of
all the diagonal measures in sight and approximates once, in that one `L¹`.

This is what makes the construction short: no monotone-class induction, no
Jordan–von Neumann argument recovering additivity from the parallelogram law,
and no operator-monotone limits.

## Sources

The construction is the classical one for the bounded Borel functional calculus of
a normal operator: represent the diagonal functionals by measures
(Riesz--Markov--Kakutani), polarise, and extend from continuous to bounded Borel
symbols by approximation in `L¹` of the diagonal measures.  It follows the standard
textbook treatment of the spectral theorem for normal operators (Rudin,
*Functional Analysis*; Conway, *A Course in Functional Analysis*) rather than any
one source's proof.

The route was chosen against the Spectra library's Herglotz/Poisson construction;
the Spectra-removal plan records that comparison, and
`ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/BorelCalculus/DiagonalMeasure.lean` carries
the provenance of the route itself.

## Provenance

*New*; see `ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/BorelCalculus/DiagonalMeasure.lean`
for the provenance of the route as a whole.
