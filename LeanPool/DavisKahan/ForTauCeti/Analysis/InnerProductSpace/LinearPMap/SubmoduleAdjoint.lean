# The double adjoint of a submodule

`Submodule.adjoint` sends a submodule of `E × F` to one of `F × E`; it is the
graph-level form of the adjoint of an unbounded operator, and Mathlib's
`LinearPMap.adjoint_graph_eq_graph_adjoint` identifies `Γ(T†)` with
`Γ(T).adjoint`.

Mathlib does not record how the operation composes with itself.  That gap is
what stops the von Neumann theorem — *the adjoint of a closed densely defined
operator is again densely defined* — from being stated, because that proof needs
`g.adjoint.adjoint = g` for a closed graph.

This module supplies that composition law and the density theorem it unlocks.

## Main results

* `Submodule.le_adjoint_adjoint`: `g ≤ g.adjoint.adjoint`, for **any** submodule.
* `Submodule.adjoint_adjoint_le`: the reverse, for a **closed** `g`.
* `Submodule.adjoint_adjoint`: `g.adjoint.adjoint = g` for closed `g` — the
  involutivity that lets the adjoint theory close on itself.
* `LinearPMap.dense_adjoint_domain`: **von Neumann's theorem** — the adjoint of a
  closed densely defined operator is itself densely defined.

## The reverse inclusion

`adjoint_adjoint_le` needs `g` closed — and genuinely so: the double adjoint is
always closed, so it contains the closure of `g`, and the inclusion fails for a
non-closed `g`.  Completeness of `E` and `F` is used only to get the orthogonal
projection.

The mechanism is one separating vector.  For closed `g` and `x ∉ g`, project in
`WithLp 2 (E × F)` to get `y = (y₁, y₂)` orthogonal to `g` with `⟪y, x⟫ ≠ 0`;
then `(a, b) := (-y₂, y₁)` lies in `g.adjoint`, because
`Submodule.mem_adjoint_iff` unfolds its membership to
`∀ (c, d) ∈ g, ⟪d, -y₂⟫ - ⟪c, y₁⟫ = 0`, which is exactly `y ⟂ g` — and the
pairing that `x ∈ g.adjoint.adjoint` would force to vanish is
`⟪b, x.1⟫ - ⟪a, x.2⟫ = ⟪y₁, x.1⟫ + ⟪y₂, x.2⟫ = ⟪y, x⟫`.

## Sources

*Follows nothing in particular*: the inclusion is the standard graph-adjoint
computation, and the proof is `Submodule.mem_adjoint_iff` on both sides.

/-- **von Neumann's theorem: the adjoint of a closed densely defined operator is
densely defined.**

This is the fact that makes the unbounded adjoint theory close on itself.  Without
it, every development iterating the adjoint — `T††`, self-adjointness criteria,
the Cayley transform, unbounded spectral theory — must carry density of the
adjoint domain as a standing hypothesis.

The proof is one separating vector.  If `y ⟂ T†.domain` then `(0, y)` lies in
`Γ(T).adjoint.adjoint`, because that membership unfolds to exactly
`∀ a ∈ T†.domain, ⟪a, y⟫ = 0`.  Closedness of `Γ(T)` collapses the double
adjoint, so `(0, y) ∈ Γ(T)`, forcing `y = T 0 = 0`. -/
