# Stone's theorem, forward direction

The generator of a one-parameter unitary group is self-adjoint.

`OneParameterUnitaryGroup.generator U` is defined as the limit of
`(U t ψ - ψ) / (i t)`, so `U t = exp (i t A)` and the expected conclusion is
that `A` is *self-adjoint* — not merely symmetric.  Symmetry alone is cheap and
was already available (`generator_isFormalAdjoint`); self-adjointness is the
statement with content, and it is the hypothesis that every spectral-calculus
consumer actually needs, since a spectral measure is built from a self-adjoint
operator and not from a symmetric one.

## The route, and why the hard step is missing

Textbook Stone runs through a mollification (Gårding) argument to show the
generator domain is dense, then produces the resolvent.  **Neither half is done
that way here.**

* **Density is free.**  If `A` is symmetric and `A + i` is *surjective*, then
  `Dom A` is dense: for `x ⊥ Dom A` pick `ψ` with `A ψ + i ψ = x`; then
  `0 = ⟪ψ, x⟫ = ⟪ψ, A ψ⟫ + i ‖ψ‖²`, whose imaginary part is `‖ψ‖²` because
  symmetry makes `⟪ψ, A ψ⟫` real.  So `ψ = 0` and hence `x = 0`.  This is
  `dense_domain_of_surjective_add_I`, and it removes the mollifier entirely.
* **Surjectivity is upstream.**  Tau Ceti's C₀-semigroup library already proves
  the Hille–Yosida resolvent identity `(λ - A) R(λ) x = x`
  (`StronglyContinuousSemigroup.resolventRightInv`).  Restricting `U` to `t ≥ 0`
  is a contraction semigroup, so `λ = 1` is admissible, and running the identity
  for `U` and for the time-reversed group `reversedGroup U` gives surjectivity of
  `A + i` and of `A - i` respectively.

What has to be supplied here is the *converse* of the Wave 3 generator bridge:
the semigroup only sees `t → 0⁺`, so its domain is a priori larger than the
group's.  For a unitary group it is not, because

`genDiffQuot U ψ (-t) = U (-t) (genDiffQuot U ψ t)`

(`genDiffQuot_neg`) and `U (-t) → 1` strongly, so a right-hand limit forces the
two-sided one.  `SemigroupBridge` flagged exactly this as the missing direction.

Note that no linearity of the resolvent over `ℂ` is used — the upstream
resolvent is only `ℝ`-linear.  The two surjectivity statements are obtained by
*choosing the input vector*, `∓i • φ`, rather than by moving a scalar through
`R`.

## Provenance

*New.*  The group structure and von Neumann's criterion come from
`OneParameterUnitaryGroup/Basic.lean` (ported from Spectra); the semigroup
resolvent is upstream Tau Ceti's.  Spectra reaches the spectral measure of a
unitary group through Bochner's theorem and a GNS construction instead, and
none of that subtree is used or needed here.

/-- **A symmetric operator with `A + i` surjective has dense domain.**  This is
the step that normally requires a mollification argument for Stone's theorem;
here it is three lines of inner-product algebra, and it is what lets

density. -/
