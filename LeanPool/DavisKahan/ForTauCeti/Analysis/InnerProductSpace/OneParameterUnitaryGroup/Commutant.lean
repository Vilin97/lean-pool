# Bounded operators commuting with a one-parameter unitary group

A bounded operator that commutes with every `U t` preserves the generator's
domain and commutes with the generator.

`Basic.lean` proves this for the group's *own* elements
(`generator_domain_invariant`).  The statement here is the same fact for an
arbitrary element of the group's commutant, and it is what a block-diagonal
argument needs: spectral projections of `A` commute with the unitary group of
`A`, so cutting a vector into spectral blocks commutes with the flow, and
therefore with the generator.

The proof is the obvious one and does not use unitarity at all — only that `T`
is continuous and linear.  The difference quotient commutes with `T` term by
term, and a continuous map carries the limit to the limit.

## Sources

That a bounded operator commutes with a one-parameter unitary group exactly when it
commutes with its generator is standard in the Stone's-theorem literature
(Reed--Simon, *Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics I*).  The form here is the one
the spectral-projection argument consumes.
