# A one-parameter unitary group is a strongly continuous semigroup

`TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup` and
`TauCeti.OneParameterUnitaryGroup` describe the same subject from two sides:
`ℝ≥0`-indexed contractions on a real Banach space with generator
`A x = lim_{t→0⁺} (S t x - x)/t`, against `ℝ`-indexed unitaries on a complex
Hilbert space with generator `A x = lim_{t→0} (U t x - x)/(i t)`.  Carrying both
as independent stacks is what convergence Wave 3 exists to stop.

This module makes the second a *specialization* of the first:

* `toSemigroup U` — restrict a unitary group to `t ≥ 0` and forget the complex
  structure;
* `generator_toSemigroup` — its semigroup generator is `i` times the group
  generator, on the group's domain.

The factor `i` is not an artefact of the encoding.  It is the Stone convention:
a one-parameter unitary group is `U t = exp (i t A)` with `A` **self-adjoint**,
so the semigroup generator `i A` is skew-adjoint, which is exactly what
generates a unitary semigroup.  Stating the bridge with the factor visible is
the point — it is where the two conventions are reconciled.

## Generator domains

The forward domain inclusion is established here. The reverse inclusion and domain
equality for unitary groups are proved downstream in `OneParameterUnitaryGroup.Stone`.

## Provenance

*New.*  `TauCeti.OneParameterUnitaryGroup` is Spectra's structure, ported in
`OneParameterUnitaryGroup/Basic.lean`; `StronglyContinuousSemigroup` is upstream
Tau Ceti's.  The bridge between them is neither's.

This is the first `ForTauCeti` module to import `TauCeti`, which the dependency
policy has always allowed (`ForTauCeti` may import Mathlib / TauCeti /
ForTauCeti) but which nothing had needed until convergence work began.
