# A projection-valued measure splits norms along a partition

`∑ ‖proj (B k) ξ‖² = ‖ξ‖²` when the `B k` are a countable measurable partition
of `ℝ`.

`Basic.lean` carries the diagonal measures as data and proves the quadratic
identity `‖proj B ξ‖² = diag ξ B` in real form.  Everything here is that
identity restated in `ℝ≥0∞`, where it says the *measure* directly, so countable
additivity of `diag ξ` — an honest Borel measure — transfers to the projections
with no summability bookkeeping.

This is the hypothesis that
`TauCeti.HilbertSchmidt.tsum_energy_isometryFamily_comp` and its two-sided
companion take: a family that splits vector norms splits the Hilbert–Schmidt
energy.  Spectral projections over a partition of the line are the instance the
block argument for the Sylvester spectral gap uses.

## Sources

*Follows nothing in particular*: one identity of `ProjValMeasure/Basic.lean` restated in
`ℝ≥0∞` so that countable additivity transfers with no summability bookkeeping.

## Provenance

*New.*
