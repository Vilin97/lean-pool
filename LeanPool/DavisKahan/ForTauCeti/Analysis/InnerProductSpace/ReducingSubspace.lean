# Reducing subspaces for bounded operators

General `RCLike` infrastructure for invariant and reducing subspaces of bounded
operators on inner-product spaces.  This module is independent of the
Davis--Kahan theory.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: authored directly in `ForMathlib` at Davis--Kahan commit
  `df036cd`; it has had no prior home.
* Extraction class: **authored in place**, for Tau Ceti — `ForMathlib` was
  retired on 2026-07-29 and `ForTauCeti` is the single staging library, whose
  destination is Tau Ceti and not Mathlib (`ForTauCeti/README.md`).
* Original authors / copyright: Jon Crall, GPT 5.6 High; Copyright (c) 2026
  Kitware, Inc.; Apache 2.0.
* Spectra influence: **none** — the `ForTauCeti` import firewall admits only
  Mathlib, `TauCeti` and `ForTauCeti` (enforced by `scripts/check_dependency_layers.py`).

/-- **A symmetric map that nearly reduces `Z` moves `Zᗮ` only slightly into `Z`.**

If `‖T x - Z.starProjection (T x)‖ ≤ ρ ‖x‖` for every `x ∈ Z` -- the quantitative form of
"`T` reduces `Z`" -- then for `w ⊥ Z` the part of `T w` lying in `Z` is at most `ρ ‖w‖`.
Symmetry is what lets the estimate be read on either side of the inner product.

At `ρ = 0` this is the qualitative statement: a symmetric map reducing `Z` maps `Zᗮ` into
`Zᗮ`, which is `ContinuousLinearMap.IsSymmetric.reduces_of_invariant` above in bounded
form. -/

/-- A subspace admitting an orthogonal projection inside a complete ambient space
is itself complete, as an instance.

`scoped` rather than global, because the search `CompleteSpace ↥U` is one that
fires on every subspace coercion and the cost of that is not worth paying in
modules that do not need it.  Activate it with

```
open scoped TauCeti.CompleteSubspace
```

**Use this one.**  It exists because the same three-line `local instance` was
written out forty-three times across `DavisKahan` and `ForTauCeti`, each under a
different name.  That is not only duplication: the instance name is part of the
*elaborated type* of every theorem whose statement compresses to a subspace, so
two modules holding private copies state provably identical theorems that the
comparator, and any exact signature comparison, reports as different.  A new
copy would put that back. -/
