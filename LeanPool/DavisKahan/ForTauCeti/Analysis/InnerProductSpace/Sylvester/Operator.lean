/-! # The bounded Sylvester operator

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: authored directly in `ForMathlib` at Davis--Kahan commit
  `df036cd`; it has had no prior home.
* Extraction class: **authored in place**, for Tau Ceti — `ForMathlib` was
  retired on 2026-07-29 and `ForTauCeti` is the single staging library, whose
  destination is Tau Ceti and not Mathlib (`ForTauCeti/README.md`).
* Original authors / copyright: Jon Crall, GPT 5.6 High; Copyright (c) 2026
  Kitware, Inc.; Apache 2.0.
* Spectra influence: **none** — the `ForTauCeti` import firewall admits only
  Mathlib, `TauCeti` and `ForTauCeti` (enforced by `scripts/check_dependency_layers.py`).

Moved from
`ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/SylvesterOperator.lean` to
`ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/Sylvester/Operator.lean`.  The `Sylvester/`
directory already held `Basic`, `Interval`, `SpectralDistance` and `Internal/`, while
six siblings of the same family used a flat `Sylvester*` prefix in the directory above;
one family now has one convention.  Path change and import repoint only — no statement,
signature, proof, attribute, declaration name or namespace changed.

/-! The Sylvester operator is a statement about composition, so it is declared
over normed spaces rather than inner product spaces: nothing here, and nothing
proved about it downstream, uses an inner product.  Consumers that do work in a
Hilbert space are unaffected, since `InnerProductSpace.toNormedSpace` supplies
the instance. -/

/-- The Sylvester operator `X ↦ A X - X B`, bundled as a continuous linear map.

`sylvesterOperator` is its underlying function.  The bundled form is what lets
the Sylvester operator be *called* injective, bounded below, or invertible:
those are statements about an operator, not about a family of values.  It is a
difference of the two one-sided composition maps, each of which is continuous
and linear in `X`. -/
