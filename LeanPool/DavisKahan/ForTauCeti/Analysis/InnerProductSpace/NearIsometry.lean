/-! # A near-isometry is close to a genuine isometry (via the polar factorization)

A linear map `M` on a finite-dimensional real inner product space whose quadratic form
`x ↦ ⟪M x, M x⟫` is uniformly `δ`-close to `x ↦ ⟪x, x⟫` (with `δ < 1`)
factors as `M = W ∘ S`
with `W` a linear isometry equivalence and `S` a square root of the Gram operator `Mᵀ ∘ M`
that moves no vector by more than `δ`.  In particular `M` lies within `δ` of the genuine
isometry `W`: `‖M x - W x‖ ≤ δ * ‖x‖`.

The factorization is the *polar decomposition* `M = W |M|`: `S = (Mᵀ M)^(1/2)` is built
directly from the orthonormal eigenbasis of the Gram operator
(`LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvectorBasis`), and `W = M ∘ S⁻¹`.  So the proof uses neither the
continuous functional calculus nor a singular value decomposition.  This keeps the
finite-dimensional proof elementary and independent of the bounded-operator
functional-calculus route.

Exposing the factorization, rather than only the estimate, is what makes the constant sharp.
Because `W` is an isometry and `M x = W (S x)`,

  `‖M x - W x‖ = ‖W (S x) - W x‖ = ‖S x - x‖`,

so the operator estimate *is* the scalar estimate `|√μ - 1| ≤ |μ - 1| ≤ δ` on the
eigenvalues
`μ` of the Gram operator (`TauCeti.Real.abs_sqrt_sub_one_le_abs_sub_one`), with no loss.
Estimating instead through `M ∘ (1 - S⁻¹)` — the route that gives the constant `2 * δ` —
pays
an avoidable `‖M‖ ≤ √(1 + δ)` factor and needs `δ ≤ 1 / 2`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LinearMap.exists_linearIsometryEquiv_comp_polarFactor`: the polar factorization
  `M = W ∘ S` with `S ∘ S = Mᵀ ∘ M`, `S` symmetric, and
  `‖S x - x‖ ≤ δ * ‖x‖`.  This is the
  primary statement; the estimates below are corollaries of it.
* `TauCeti.LinearMap.exists_linearIsometryEquiv_norm_sub_apply_le` and
  `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.exists_linearIsometryEquiv_norm_sub_apply_le`: the sharp
  near-isometry estimate `‖M x - W x‖ ≤ δ * ‖x‖`, under the pointwise quadratic-form
  hypothesis and the operator-norm hypothesis `‖Mᵀ M - 1‖ ≤ δ` respectively.
* `TauCeti.LinearMap.exists_linearIsometryEquiv_norm_sub_le` and
  `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.exists_linearIsometryEquiv_norm_sub_le`: the historical
  statements, with the weaker constant `2 * δ` under `δ ≤ 1 / 2`.  Retained because they are
  the form quoted by the downstream paper development and by the challenge comparator; both
  are now one-line corollaries.

## Design note: why retain the finite-dimensional factorization

`ForTauCeti/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/Polar/Isometry.lean` defines the canonical bounded polar
isometry `ContinuousLinearMap.polarIsometryOfIsUnitModulus M = M ∘L Ring.inverse |M|` over an
arbitrary `RCLike` field and proves the same sharp estimate without a finite-dimensionality
assumption.  The theorem here is retained because its conclusion exposes the finite spectral
factorization data directly: it returns `W` and `S`, with `S ∘ S = Mᵀ ∘ M`, symmetry of `S`,
and the pointwise square-root estimate.  Downstream finite-dimensional arguments use those
witnesses, while callers that only need the canonical bounded factor can use `Polar/Isometry.lean`.

## Scalars: what is open, and what it would cost

The operator results here are stated over `ℝ`.  The `RCLike` form is open, and the
obstruction is bookkeeping rather than mathematics: the eigenbasis machinery
(`LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvectorBasis`) already works over `RCLike`, so what has to be
redone is the real-inner-product arithmetic in the proofs below — the places where a real
inner product is used as a real number without a `RCLike.re`.

**This is a different situation from the entrywise operator-norm bound in
`ForTauCeti/Analysis/Matrix/EntrywiseOpNorm.lean`**, whose `RCLike` form needs a
re-derivation because `Matrix.toEuclideanLin` changes convention over `𝕜`.  Here the
statements are convention-free and only the proofs move.

/-- **Polar factorization of a near-isometry.**  If the quadratic form of a linear map `M` on a
finite-dimensional real inner product space is uniformly `δ`-close to the identity quadratic
form (`|⟪M x, M x⟫ - ⟪x, x⟫| ≤ δ * ⟪x, x⟫`, with `δ < 1`), then `M` factors
as `M = W ∘ S`
where

* `W` is a linear isometry equivalence of `E`,
* `S` is the modulus of `M`: symmetric, with `S ∘ S = Mᵀ ∘ M`, and
* `S` moves no vector by more than `δ`: `‖S x - x‖ ≤ δ * ‖x‖`.

`S` is built from the orthonormal eigenbasis of the Gram operator `Mᵀ ∘ M`, rescaling the
`k`-th eigenvector by `√(μ k)`; `W = M ∘ S⁻¹` is an isometry because
`⟪M b_j, M b_k⟫ = μ_j δ_jk`
on that basis.  Since the two stated properties of `S` determine it (a symmetric square root of
`Mᵀ M` that is close to the identity is *the* positive square root), this statement exposes the
canonical polar factor rather than an arbitrary witness — see the module docstring for why the
real case is stated existentially at all.

The hypothesis `δ < 1` is exactly what is needed: it forces the eigenvalues `μ k ≥ 1 - δ` of
the Gram operator to be positive, so that `S` is invertible and `M` is bounded below. -/

finite-dimensional real inner product space is uniformly `δ`-close to the identity quadratic
form (with `δ < 1`), then `M` lies within `δ` — not `2 * δ` — of a genuine linear isometry
equivalence.

This is immediate from `exists_linearIsometryEquiv_comp_polarFactor`: `M x - W x` is the image
under the isometry `W` of `S x - x`. -/
