/-! # Upper hemicontinuity of the argmin correspondence over a fixed compact set

This is the *fixed-constraint case* of Berge's maximum theorem: the feasible set
`K` does not vary with the parameter `p`.  (The classical Berge theorem allows a
parameter-varying constraint correspondence; that more general case is not
formalized here.)

Let `g : P → X → ℝ` be jointly continuous and let `K ⊆ X` be a fixed nonempty
compact set.  Consider the parametric minimization of `g p` over `K`, with
argmin correspondence
`M p = {x ∈ K | IsMinOn (g p) K x}`.
In this fixed-constraint setting, the value function `p ↦ ⨅ x ∈ K, g p x` is
continuous and the correspondence `M` is upper hemicontinuous (and compact-valued
and nonempty).

Mathlib has the hemicontinuity *definitions* (`Mathlib/Topology/Semicontinuity/
Hemicontinuity.lean`) and the extreme-value theorem (`IsCompact.exists_isMinOn`),
but no Berge theorem.  This file supplies the upper-hemicontinuity half in two
usable forms, building on the approximate-minimizer stability engine
`TauCeti.exists_subseq_tendsto_isMinOn_of_approxMinOn`:

* `tendsto_eval_sub_of_isCompact` — along a convergent parameter sequence
  `p k → p₀`, the evaluation difference `g (p k) (x k) − g p₀ (x k)` vanishes
  uniformly over points `x k` staying in the compact `K` (a uniform-convergence-
  on-compacts fact, here in the sequential form actually needed).
* `tendsto_subseq_isMinOn_of_isMinOn` — **sequential upper hemicontinuity**: any
  sequence of constrained minimizers `x k ∈ argmin (g (p k))` for `p k → p₀` has
  a subsequence converging to a constrained minimizer of `g p₀`.  This is the
  closed-graph form of Berge's theorem.
* `upperHemicontinuousAt_isMinOn` — the same conclusion phrased through Mathlib's
  own `UpperHemicontinuousAt` predicate for the argmin correspondence
  `p ↦ {x ∈ K | IsMinOn (g p) K x}` (requires `X` Hausdorff so the compact `K` is
  closed and limits of feasible points stay feasible).
* `exists_modulus_isMinOn_family` / `exists_modulus_isMinOn` — the **uniform
  `ε`–`δ` modulus** form (metric `P`): for every `ε > 0` there is a `δ > 0` such
  that whenever `dist p p₀ ≤ δ`, *every* minimizer of `g p` over `K` is `ε`-close
  (in the ambient metric, or in any finite family of continuous invariants) to
  *some* minimizer of `g p₀` over `K`.  The family form lets closeness be measured
  by a finite family of continuous invariants rather than the ambient metric,
  which is useful when minimizers are only determined up to a symmetry group.

## Staging note

Staged for Tau Ceti, roadmap topic T22.  Mathlib is not the destination
(`ForTauCeti/README.md`); what follows is where this material would have gone on
the closed Mathlib track —
the Berge maximum theorem (upper hemicontinuity of the
parametric argmin correspondence over a fixed compact feasible set).
Formalized by Claude Opus 4.8 (claude-opus-4-8[1m]); golfed a terminal

### Provenance

Moved from the retired `ForMathlib` staging tree into `ForTauCeti/Topology/`.
`ForMathlib` to `TauCeti` to match the destination package; declaration names,
statements and proofs are unchanged.

**FM-RETIRE was worked twice, and the two versions disagreed on the namespace.**
The `main` version (`c85510d6`) kept `namespace ForMathlib` here, reasoning that
`Challenge/**/Conformance.lean` is immutable so its `ForMathlib.*` pins could not
be re-issued.  Reconciled on merge in favour of `TauCeti`, because the pins are
not what immutability protects: `AGENTS.md`'s comparator rule forbids *filling the
proof placeholders*, and its rename protocol explicitly requires a dedicated rename pass to
update `Challenge/` and `comparator/*.json`, which is what was done — the three
Berge names in `comparator/challenge-berge.json`, the `#print axioms` lines in
`Challenge/Berge/Leaderboard.lean`, and the restated statements in
the paired `Conformance.lean` all read `TauCeti.*`.  Leaving `ForMathlib.*`
declarations inside `ForTauCeti` would also contradict the package rule that its
declarations live in their final `TauCeti.*` namespaces (`lakefile.toml`).

/-- **Sequential uniform convergence on a compact set from joint continuity.**
If `g : P → X → ℝ` is jointly continuous, `p k → p₀`, and the points `x k` stay in
a compact set `K`, then the evaluation difference `g (p k) (x k) − g p₀ (x k)`
tends to `0`.  (This is the only consequence of "`g (p k) → g p₀` uniformly on
`K`" needed for Berge; it is proved directly via the subsequence criterion and
sequential compactness, avoiding the compact-open topology.) -/

The same conclusion as `upperHemicontinuousAt_isMinOn` below, but free of
`[FirstCountableTopology X]` and `[(𝓝 p₀).IsCountablyGenerated]`: those are artifacts of
routing the proof through `UpperHemicontinuousAt.of_sequences`, not features of the
mathematics.

The argument is the classical one.  Let `V` be open around the `p₀`-argmin set.  If `K ⊆ V`
there is nothing to do; otherwise `K \ V` is compact and nonempty, and no point of it
minimises `g p₀`, so the minimum of `g p₀` over `K \ V` strictly exceeds its minimum over
`K`.  Take `ε` a third of that gap and move `p` close enough that `g p` is uniformly within
`ε` of `g p₀` on `K`: a minimiser of `g p` outside `V` would then be within `2ε` of the
smaller value, contradicting the `3ε` gap. -/

/-- **Upper hemicontinuity of the argmin correspondence over a fixed compact set
(the fixed-constraint case of Berge's maximum theorem), via Mathlib's
`UpperHemicontinuousAt`.**
For jointly continuous `g` and compact `K`, the argmin correspondence
`p ↦ {x ∈ K | IsMinOn (g p) K x}` is upper hemicontinuous at `p₀` in the sense of
`Mathlib.Topology.Semicontinuity.Hemicontinuity`.

This lands the closed-graph statement on Mathlib's own predicate.  It carries no
countability or separation hypothesis: the earlier route through
`UpperHemicontinuousAt.of_sequences` needed `[FirstCountableTopology X]`,
`[T2Space X]` and `[(𝓝 p₀).IsCountablyGenerated]`, and
`upperHemicontinuousAt_isMinOn_of_isCompact` does without them. -/

For jointly continuous `g`, a fixed nonempty compact `K`, and `P` first-countable,

This is the second half of the fixed-constraint statement (alongside the upper
hemicontinuity of the argmin correspondence above).  The proof is the standard
squeeze: with `xₖ` a
minimizer of `g (p k)` and `x₀` a minimizer of `g p₀`,
`V p₀ + (g (p k) xₖ − g p₀ xₖ) ≤ V (p k) ≤ g (p k) x₀`,
where the lower bound tends to `V p₀` via `tendsto_eval_sub_of_isCompact` and the

With `P` a (pseudo)metric space, `g` jointly continuous, `K` a fixed compact set,
and closeness measured by a *finite family* of jointly-continuous functionals
`ρ i : X → X → ℝ` with `ρ i x x = 0` (a family of continuous invariants, not
necessarily a metric): for every `ε > 0` there is `δ > 0` such that whenever
`dist p p₀ ≤ δ`, *every* feasible minimizer `x` of `g p` over `K` (i.e. `x ∈ K`
with `IsMinOn (g p) K x`) is `ρ`-within `ε` of *some* feasible minimizer `x₀` of
`g p₀` over `K` (`∀ i, ρ i x x₀ < ε`).

The `δ` depends only on `p₀` and `ε` (a genuine modulus of upper hemicontinuity),
which lets one avoid measurable selection of minimizers.  The closeness family
captures *invariant* closeness measures for which the ambient metric is not the
right notion — for instance when minimizers are only determined up to a symmetry
group, so that closeness should be measured by group-invariant functionals. -/

/-! ### Varying constraints: the lower-hemicontinuous half

The theorems above fix the feasible set `K`.  Berge's theorem allows `K` to vary
with the parameter, and the two bounds on the value function then come from
*different* hypotheses: lower hemicontinuity of `K` gives the upper bound, upper
hemicontinuity together with compactness gives the lower one.

This section supplies the first.  The content is that a feasible point at `p₀`
can be approximately tracked at nearby parameters -- which is exactly what lower
hemicontinuity says -- and joint continuity then transfers the value.
-/

/-- **Feasible points can be tracked, with their values.**

If `K` is lower hemicontinuous at `p₀`, `g` is jointly continuous, and `y` is
feasible at `p₀`, then for every `ε > 0` all nearby parameters admit a feasible
point whose value beats `g p₀ y + ε`.

Lower hemicontinuity alone gives a nearby *feasible* point; joint continuity is
what makes its *value* close.  Neither hypothesis can be dropped: without the
first the nearby constraint sets could avoid a neighbourhood of `y` entirely,
and without the second a feasible point close to `y` need not have a close
value. -/

Berge's value theorem that lower hemicontinuity buys; the matching lower bound
`V p₀ ≤ liminf V p` is where upper hemicontinuity and compactness of the
constraint sets do their work, and is not proved here.

The infimum is taken over the subtype `↥(K p)`, so a nonemptiness hypothesis is
needed for it to be meaningful, and boundedness below for `ciInf_le` to apply. -/

/-! ### Varying constraints: the upper-hemicontinuous half

Where lower hemicontinuity above gave the *upper* bound on the value function,
upper hemicontinuity gives the reverse one, and it does so through a single
fact: a limit of feasible points stays feasible.
-/

/-- **Feasibility passes to limits under upper hemicontinuity.**

If `pₖ → p₀`, each `xₖ` is feasible at `pₖ`, and `xₖ → x₀`, then `x₀` is
feasible at `p₀`.

**This is the step that fails without upper hemicontinuity**: nothing otherwise
stops the constraint sets from collapsing away from `x₀` in the limit, and a
minimizer extracted from the `xₖ` would not be a competitor at `p₀`.

The separation hypotheses are genuine rather than artifacts.  `x₀ ∉ K p₀` with
`K p₀` closed gives disjoint opens `U ∋ x₀` and `V ⊇ K p₀`; upper
hemicontinuity puts `K p` inside `V` eventually, while convergence puts `xₖ`
inside `U` eventually, and `xₖ ∈ K pₖ` then contradicts disjointness. -/

/-- **Subsequence extraction for a varying constraint family.**

From feasible points `xₖ ∈ K pₖ` with `pₖ → p₀`, extract a convergent
subsequence whose limit is feasible at `p₀`.

**The local-boundedness hypothesis is what makes this possible and cannot be
weakened to "each `K p` is compact":** a family of individually compact sets can
march off to infinity as `p → p₀`, leaving no compact set to extract from.  A
single compact `C` containing `K p` for all `p` near `p₀` is the standard Berge
assumption and rules exactly that out.

Given it, the two hemicontinuity lanes supply the rest: compactness of `C`
produces the convergent subsequence, and
`mem_of_tendsto_of_upperHemicontinuousAt` returns its limit to `K p₀`. -/

/-- **Local boundedness comes free in a locally compact ambient space.**

If `K p₀` is compact and `K` is upper hemicontinuous at `p₀`, then some compact
`C` contains `K p` for every `p` near `p₀`.

This reconciles `exists_subseq_tendsto_mem_of_upperHemicontinuousAt`, which
assumes such a `C`, with the usual statement of Berge's theorem, which assumes
only that each `K p` is compact.  Those are genuinely different hypotheses --
individually compact sets can escape to infinity as `p → p₀` — but the escape
needs a non-locally-compact ambient space, so it cannot happen here.

The proof is the reason upper hemicontinuity is stated with neighbourhoods
rather than with sets: `exists_compact_superset` puts `K p₀` inside the
*interior* of a compact `C`, and that interior is an open set to which upper
hemicontinuity directly applies. -/

`V p₀`.  With the matching lower statement this gives continuity of `V`; the two
halves are *not* symmetric — this one is what lower hemicontinuity buys, and the
other needs upper hemicontinuity and the compactness extraction.

The compactness of `K p₀` is used only to produce a genuine minimizer there, so
that the bound from `eventually_iInf_lt_of_lowerHemicontinuousAt` can be stated
against `V p₀` itself rather than against an approximate value. -/
