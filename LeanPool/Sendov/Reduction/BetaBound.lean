# The simplified polar inequality `β(1) ≤ α/(3+α)`

This is `(lt) ⟹ (beta-bound)`.  Evaluating the integral,

  `∫₀¹ exp(α(-1 + (2-B)t)) dt = e^{-u} · sinh h / h`,   `u = αB/2`,  `h = α(2-B)/2`,

so `(lt)` says `e^u ≤ sinh h / h`, and `Sendov.log_sinh_div_le` turns that into
`u ≤ √(h²+9) - 3`.  Since `h = α - u`, squaring `u + 3 ≤ √((α-u)² + 9)` gives
`u(6 + 2α) ≤ α²`, that is `B ≤ α/(3+α)`.

The constant `3` is optimal: at `B = α/(3+α)` the slack in `(lt)` is `-α⁵/540 + α⁶/648`, so
the bound is tight to three orders at `α = 0`.  This is the one link of the chain with no room
in it anywhere.

One degenerate case has to be cleared first, and `(lt)` clears it: if `B ≥ 2` then the
integrand is at most `e^{-α} < 1` throughout, so the integral is below `1`.  Hence `B < 2` and
`h > 0`, which is what the `sinh` estimate needs.

## Main statements

* `Sendov.integral_exp_eq`: the closed form of the integral in `(lt)`;
* `Sendov.beta_lt_two`: `(lt)` forces `B < 2`;
* `Sendov.beta_le`: `(lt) ⟹ B ≤ α/(3+α)`.
