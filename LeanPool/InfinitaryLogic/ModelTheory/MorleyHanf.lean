# The Morley–Hanf theorem: public facade and corollaries

The stable entry point for the project's headline Hanf-number result. Importing this file (or
any bundle containing it, including the default `import InfinitaryLogic`) exposes

* `morley_hanf : IsHanfBound φ (ℶ_ω₁)` — for every `L_{ω₁ω}` sentence over an arbitrary
  language, with no hypotheses (proved in `Conditional/MorleyHanfSchemaDischarge.lean`);

together with the corollaries packaged here:

* `hanfNumber_le_beth_omega1` — the per-sentence Hanf number is at most `ℶ_{ω₁}`;
* `IsLomega1omegaHanfBound` / `Lomega1omegaHanfNumber` — the GLOBAL Hanf bound/number of the
  logic `L_{ω₁ω}` (over all languages and sentences), with
  `beth_omega1_isLomega1omegaHanfBound` and `Lomega1omegaHanfNumber_le_beth_omega1`. This is
  the upper half of the classical `Hanf(L_{ω₁ω}) = ℶ_{ω₁}`; the matching lower half and the
  exact equality `Lomega1omegaHanfNumber_eq_beth_omega1` are proved by the beth-ladder
  spectrum witnesses in `HanfSpectrum/BethLadder.lean`;
* `morley_hanf_theory` — every countable `L_{ω₁ω}`-theory with a model of size `≥ ℶ_{ω₁}` has
  arbitrarily large models (via `Theoryω.conjunction`).
